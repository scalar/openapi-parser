A QUERY Block object contains the query text, alias and link to the associated Query results block object.</p> </li> <li> <p>Query Result. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query and an ID that connects it to the query asked.

      description: "<p>Starts the classification and analysis of an input document. <code>StartLendingAnalysis</code> initiates the classification and analysis of a packet of lending documents. <code>StartLendingAnalysis</code> operates on a document file located in an Amazon S3 bucket.</p> <p> <code>StartLendingAnalysis</code> can analyze text in documents that are in one of the following formats: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, PDF. Use <code>DocumentLocation</code> to specify the bucket name and the file name of the document. </p> <p> <code>StartLendingAnalysis</code> returns a job identifier (<code>JobId</code>) that you use to get the results of the operation. When the text analysis is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in <code>NotificationChannel</code>. To get the results of the text analysis operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If the status is SUCCEEDED you can call either <code>GetLendingAnalysis</code> or <code>GetLendingAnalysisSummary</code> and provide the <code>JobId</code> to obtain the results of the analysis.</p> <p>If using <code>OutputConfig</code> to specify an Amazon S3 bucket, the output will be contained within the specified prefix in a directory labeled with the job-id. In the directory there are 3 sub-directories: </p> <ul> <li> <p>detailedResponse (contains the GetLendingAnalysis response)</p> </li> <li> <p>summaryResponse (for the GetLendingAnalysisSummary response)</p> </li> <li> <p>splitDocuments (documents split across logical boundaries)</p> </li> </ul>"
