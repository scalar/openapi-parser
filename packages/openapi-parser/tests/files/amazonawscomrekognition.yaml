      operationId: CompareFaces
      description: <p>Compares a face in the <i>source</i> input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the <i>target</i> input image. </p> <p> If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image. </p> <note> <p>CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use <code>CompareFaces</code> to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action.</p> </note> <p>You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. </p> <p>In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, roll, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. </p> <note> <p>By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.</p> </note> <p> <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.</p> <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use <code>QualityFilter</code> to set the quality bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. </p> <p>If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.</p> <p>If no faces are detected in the source or target images, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. </p> <note> <p> This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.</p> </note> <p>For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CompareFaces</code> action.</p>

The source and destination projects can be in different AWS accounts but must be in the same AWS Region. You can't copy a model to another AWS service. </p> <p>To copy a model version to a different AWS account, you need to create a resource-based policy known as a <i>project policy</i>. You attach the project policy to the source project by calling <a>PutProjectPolicy</a>. The project policy gives permission to copy the model version from a trusting AWS account to a trusted account.</p> <p>For more information creating and attaching a project policy, see Attaching a project policy (SDK) in the <i>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>If you are copying a model version to a project in the same AWS account, you don't need to create a project policy.</p> <note> <p>To copy a model, the destination project, source project, and source model version must already exist.</p> </note> <p>Copying a model version takes a while to complete. To get the current status, call <a>DescribeProjectVersions</a> and check the value of <code>Status</code> in the <a>ProjectVersionDescription</a> object. The copy operation has finished when the value of <code>Status</code> is <code>COPYING_COMPLETED</code>.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CopyProjectVersion</code> action.</p>

After you have finished analyzing a streaming video, use <a>StopStreamProcessor</a> to stop processing.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are creating a stream processor to detect labels, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream (<code>Input</code>), Amazon S3 bucket information (<code>Output</code>), and an Amazon SNS topic ARN (<code>NotificationChannel</code>). You can also provide a KMS key ID to encrypt the data sent to your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify what you want to detect by using the <code>ConnectedHome</code> option in settings, and selecting one of the following: <code>PERSON</code>, <code>PET</code>, <code>PACKAGE</code>, <code>ALL</code> You can also specify where in the frame you want Amazon Rekognition to monitor with <code>RegionsOfInterest</code>. When you run the <a>StartStreamProcessor</a> operation on a label detection stream processor, you input start and stop information to determine the length of the processing time.</p> </li> </ul> <p> Use <code>Name</code> to assign an identifier for the stream processor.

If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <p> <b>Optional Parameters</b> </p> <p>You can specify one or both of the <code>GENERAL_LABELS</code> and <code>IMAGE_PROPERTIES</code> feature types when calling the DetectLabels API. Including <code>GENERAL_LABELS</code> will ensure the response includes the labels detected in the input image, while including <code>IMAGE_PROPERTIES </code>will ensure the response includes information about the image quality and color.</p> <p>When using <code>GENERAL_LABELS</code> and/or <code>IMAGE_PROPERTIES</code> you can provide filtering criteria to the Settings parameter. You can filter with sets of individual labels or with label categories. You can specify inclusive filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive filters. For more information on filtering see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/labels-detect-labels-image.html\">Detecting Labels in an Image</a>.</p> <p>You can specify <code>MinConfidence</code> to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the <code>MaxLabels</code> parameter to limit the number of labels returned. The default and upper limit is 1000 labels.</p> <p> <b>Response Elements</b> </p> <p> For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. The API returns the following types of information about labels:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Name - The name of the detected label. </p> </li> <li> <p> Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object. </p> </li> <li> <p> Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. DetectLabels returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response. </p> </li> <li> <p> Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label. </p> </li> <li> <p> Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to. </p> </li> <li> <p> BoundingBox — Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels, returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, describing the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box. </p> </li> </ul> <p> The API returns the following information regarding the image, as part of the ImageProperties structure:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Quality - Information about the Sharpness, Brightness, and Contrast of the input image, scored between 0 to 100. Image quality is returned for the entire image, as well as the background and the foreground. </p> </li> <li> <p>Dominant Color - An array of the dominant colors in the image. </p> </li> <li> <p>Foreground - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image’s foreground. </p> </li> <li> <p>Background - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image’s background.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The list of returned labels will include at least one label for every detected object, along with information about that label. In the following example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object, as well as the confidence in the label:</p> <p> <code>{Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}</code> </p> <p> <code> {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}</code> </p> <p>The list of labels can include multiple labels for the same object. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels. </p> <p> <code>{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p>In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.</p> <note> <p>If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the <a>DetectFaces</a> operation provides.</p> </note> <p>This is a stateless API operation that doesn't return any data.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:DetectLabels</code> action. </p>"

GetLabelDetection returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label.

You start text detection by calling <a>StartTextDetection</a> which returns a job identifier (<code>JobId</code>) When the text detection operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to <code>StartTextDetection</code>. To get the results of the text detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is <code>SUCCEEDED</code>. if so, call <code>GetTextDetection</code> and pass the job identifier (<code>JobId</code>) from the initial call of <code>StartLabelDetection</code>.</p> <p> <code>GetTextDetection</code> returns an array of detected text (<code>TextDetections</code>) sorted by the time the text was detected, up to 50 words per frame of video.</p> <p>Each element of the array includes the detected text, the precentage confidence in the acuracy of the detected text, the time the text was detected, bounding box information for where the text was located, and unique identifiers for words and their lines.</p> <p>Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of text detections returned. If there are more results than specified in <code>MaxResults</code>, the value of <code>NextToken</code> in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call <code>GetTextDetection</code> and populate the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to <code>GetTextDetection</code>.</p>

      description: "<p>Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection. </p> <p>Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the <a>SearchFaces</a> and <a>SearchFacesByImage</a> operations.</p> <p>For more information, see Adding faces to a collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p> <p>To get the number of faces in a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>. </p> <p>If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, <code>IndexFaces</code> indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image. </p> <p>If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the <code>OrientationCorrection</code> field. </p> <p>To determine which version of the model you're using, call <a>DescribeCollection</a> and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of <code>FaceModelVersion</code> in the response from <code>IndexFaces</code> </p> <p>For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p> <p>If you provide the optional <code>ExternalImageId</code> for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the <a>ListFaces</a> operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image.</p> <p>You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the <code>MaxFaces</code> input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background.</p> <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By default, <code>IndexFaces</code> chooses the quality bar that's used to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use <code>QualityFilter</code>, to set the quality bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. </p> <note> <p>To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>. </p> </note> <p>Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of <a>UnindexedFace</a> objects, <code>UnindexedFaces</code>. Faces aren't indexed for reasons such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the <code>MaxFaces</code> request parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p>The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.</p> </li> <li> <p>The face is too blurry.</p> </li> <li> <p>The image is too dark.</p> </li> <li> <p>The face has an extreme pose.</p> </li> <li> <p>The face doesn’t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In response, the <code>IndexFaces</code> operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, <code>FaceRecords</code>. This includes: </p> <ul> <li> <p>The bounding box, <code>BoundingBox</code>, of the detected face. </p> </li> <li> <p>A confidence value, <code>Confidence</code>, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face.</p> </li> <li> <p>A face ID, <code>FaceId</code>, assigned by the service for each face that's detected and stored.</p> </li> <li> <p>An image ID, <code>ImageId</code>, assigned by the service for the input image.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you request all facial attributes (by using the <code>detectionAttributes</code> parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the <code>IndexFaces</code> operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate face metadata.</p> <p/> <p>The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. </p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:IndexFaces</code> action.</p>"

For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350x50 pixels, the API returns a <code>left</code> value of 0.5 (350/700) and a <code>top</code> value of 0.25 (50/200).</p> <p>The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values represent the dimensions of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image dimension. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the bounding box width is 70 pixels, the width returned is 0.1. </p> <note> <p> The bounding box coordinates can have negative values. For example, if Amazon Rekognition is able to detect a face that is at the image edge and is only partially visible, the service can return coordinates that are outside the image bounds and, depending on the image edge, you might get negative values or values greater than 1 for the <code>left</code> or <code>top</code> values. </p> </note>
