      description: The `/accounts/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance for each of an Item's accounts. While other endpoints may return a balance object, only `/accounts/balance/get` forces the available and current balance fields to be refreshed rather than cached. This endpoint can be used for existing Items that were added via any of Plaid’s other products. This endpoint can be used as long as Link has been initialized with any other product, `balance` itself is not a product that can be used to initialize Link. As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints; if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

  /accounts/get:
    post:
      description: |-
        The `/accounts/get` endpoint can be used to retrieve a list of accounts associated with any linked Item. Plaid will only return active bank accounts — that is, accounts that are not closed and are capable of carrying a balance.
        For items that went through the updated account selection pane, this endpoint only returns accounts that were permissioned by the user when they initially created the Item. If a user creates a new account after the initial link, you can capture this event through the [`NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/items/#new_accounts_available) webhook and then use Link's [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/) to request that the user share this new account with you.

        This endpoint retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh information from the institution. As a result, balances returned may not be up-to-date; for realtime balance information, use `/accounts/balance/get` instead. Note that some information is nullable.

        Plaid can provide an Audit Copy of any Asset Report directly to a participating third party on your behalf. For example, Plaid can supply an Audit Copy directly to Fannie Mae on your behalf if you participate in the Day 1 Certainty™ program. An Audit Copy contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report.

        To grant access to an Audit Copy, use the `/asset_report/audit_copy/create` endpoint to create an `audit_copy_token` and then pass that token to the third party who needs access. Each third party has its own `auditor_id`, for example `fannie_mae`. You’ll need to create a separate Audit Copy for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.

        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint initiates the process of creating an Asset Report, which can then be retrieved by passing the `asset_report_token` return value to the `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoints.

        The Asset Report takes some time to be created and is not available immediately after calling `/asset_report/create`. When the Asset Report is ready to be retrieved using `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, Plaid will fire a `PRODUCT_READY` webhook. For full details of the webhook schema, see [Asset Report webhooks](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#webhooks).

        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint creates an Asset Report at a moment in time. Asset Reports are immutable. To get an updated Asset Report, use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint.

        By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Account Select view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `/accounts/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint.

        To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the `/asset_report/create` endpoint to create the report, then send the `asset_report_token` along with a list of `account_ids` to exclude to the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report's data.

        Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling `/asset_report/filter` does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, `/asset_report/filter` creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id. Asset Reports created via `/asset_report/filter` do not contain new Asset data, and are not billed.

        Plaid will fire a [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook once generation of the filtered Asset Report has completed.

        The `/asset_report/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in JSON format. Before calling `/asset_report/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/asset_report/create` (or filter an Asset Report using `/asset_report/filter`) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

        By default, an Asset Report includes transaction descriptions as returned by the bank, as opposed to parsed and categorized by Plaid. You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report.

        To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call the `/asset_report/get` endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.

        The `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in PDF format. Before calling `/asset_report/pdf/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/asset_report/create` (or filter an Asset Report using `/asset_report/filter`) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

        The response to `/asset_report/pdf/get` is the PDF binary data. The `request_id`  is returned in the `Plaid-Request-ID` header.

  /asset_report/refresh:
    post:
      description: |-
        An Asset Report is an immutable snapshot of a user's assets. In order to "refresh" an Asset Report you created previously, you can use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint to create a new Asset Report based on the old one, but with the most recent data available.

        The new Asset Report will contain the same Items as the original Report, as well as the same filters applied by any call to `/asset_report/filter`. By default, the new Asset Report will also use the same parameters you submitted with your original `/asset_report/create` request, but the original `days_requested` value and the values of any parameters in the `options` object can be overridden with new values. To change these arguments, simply supply new values for them in your request to `/asset_report/refresh`. Submit an empty string ("") for any previously-populated fields you would like set as empty.

        The `/item/remove` endpoint allows you to invalidate an `access_token`, meaning you will not be able to create new Asset Reports with it. Removing an Item does not affect any Asset Reports or Audit Copies you have already created, which will remain accessible until you remove them specifically.

        The `/asset_report/remove` endpoint allows you to remove an Asset Report. Removing an Asset Report invalidates its `asset_report_token`, meaning you will no longer be able to use it to access Report data or create new Audit Copies. Removing an Asset Report does not affect the underlying Items, but does invalidate any `audit_copy_tokens` associated with the Asset Report.

        The `/auth/get` endpoint returns the bank account and bank identification numbers (such as routing numbers, for US accounts) associated with an Item's checking and savings accounts, along with high-level account data and balances when available.

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `auth` was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the data.

        Versioning note: In API version 2017-03-08, the schema of the `numbers` object returned by this endpoint is substantially different. For details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2018-05-22).

        Use the `/bank_transfer/balance/get` endpoint to see the available balance in your bank transfer account. Debit transfers increase this balance once their status is posted. Credit transfers decrease this balance when they are created.

        The transactable balance shows the amount in your account that you are able to use for transfers, and is essentially your available balance minus your minimum balance.

        Note that this endpoint can only be used with FBO accounts, when using Bank Transfers in the Full Service configuration. It cannot be used on your own account when using Bank Transfers in the BTS Platform configuration.

Note that Items created in this way are not compatible with endpoints for other products, such as `/accounts/balance/get`, and can only be used with Bank Transfer endpoints.  If you require access to other endpoints, create the Item through Link instead.  Access to `/bank_transfer/migrate_account` is not enabled by default; to obtain access, contact your Plaid Account Manager.

  /credit/audit_copy_token/create:
    post:
      description: |-
        Plaid can create an Audit Copy token of an Asset Report and/or Income Report to share with participating Government Sponsored Entity (GSE). If you participate in the Day 1 Certainty™ program, Plaid can supply an Audit Copy token directly to Fannie Mae on your behalf. An Audit Copy token contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report and/or Income Report (result of /credit/payroll_income/get).

        Use the `/credit/audit_copy_token/create` endpoint to create an `audit_copy_token` and then pass that token to the GSE who needs access.

  /credit/audit_copy_token/remove:
    post:
      description: The `/credit/audit_copy_token/remove` endpoint allows you to remove an Audit Copy. Removing an Audit Copy invalidates the `audit_copy_token` associated with it, meaning both you and any third parties holding the token will no longer be able to use it to access Report data. Items associated with the Report data and other Audit Copies of it are not affected and will remain accessible after removing the given Audit Copy.

        `/credit/payroll_income/precheck` is an optional endpoint that can be called before initializing a Link session for income verification. It evaluates whether a given user is supportable by digital income verification. If the user is eligible for digital verification, that information will be associated with the user token, and in this way will generate a Link UI optimized for the end user and their specific employer. If the user cannot be confirmed as eligible, the user can still use the income verification flow, but they may be required to manually upload a paystub to verify their income.

        While all request fields are optional, providing `employer` data will increase the chance of receiving a useful result.

        When testing in Sandbox, you can control the results by providing special test values in the `employer` and `access_tokens` fields. `employer_good` and `employer_bad` will result in `HIGH` and `LOW` confidence values, respectively. `employer_multi` will result in a `HIGH` confidence with multiple payroll options. Likewise, `access_good` and `access_bad` will result in `HIGH` and `LOW` confidence values, respectively. Any other value for `employer` and `access_tokens` in Sandbox will result in `UNKNOWN` confidence.

        Plaid can share an Asset Report directly with a participating third party on your behalf. The shared Asset Report is the exact same Asset Report originally created in `/asset_report/create`.

        To grant a third party access to an Asset Report, use the `/credit/relay/create` endpoint to create a `relay_token` and then pass that token to your third party. Each third party has its own `secondary_client_id`; for example, `ce5bd328dcd34123456`. You'll need to create a separate `relay_token` for each third party that needs access to the report on your behalf.

  /employers/search:
    post:
      description: |-
        `/employers/search` allows you the ability to search Plaid’s database of known employers, for use with Deposit Switch. You can use this endpoint to look up a user's employer in order to confirm that they are supported. Users with non-supported employers can then be routed out of the Deposit Switch flow.

        The data in the employer database is currently limited. As the Deposit Switch and Income products progress through their respective beta periods, more employers are being regularly added. Because the employer database is frequently updated, we recommend that you do not cache or store data from this endpoint for more than a day.

        The `/identity/get` endpoint allows you to retrieve various account holder information on file with the financial institution, including names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses. Only name data is guaranteed to be returned; other fields will be empty arrays if not provided by the institution.

        This request may take some time to complete if identity was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the data.

        Note: In API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier, the `owners` object is not returned, and instead identity information is returned in the top level `identity` object. For more details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2019-05-29).

        The `/identity/match` endpoint generates a match score, which indicates how well the provided identity data matches the identity information on file with the account holder's financial institution.

        This request may take some time to complete if Identity was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the data.

        Create a new Identity Verification for the user specified by the `client_user_id` field. The requirements and behavior of the verification are determined by the `template_id` provided.
        If you don't know whether the associated user already has an active Identity Verification, you can specify `"is_idempotent": true` in the request body. With idempotency enabled, a new Identity Verification will only be created if one does not already exist for the associated `client_user_id` and `template_id`. If an Identity Verification is found, it will be returned unmodified with an `200 OK` HTTP status code.

        `/income/verification/precheck` is an optional endpoint that can be called before initializing a Link session for income verification. It evaluates whether a given user is supportable by digital income verification and returns a `precheck_id` that can be provided to `/link/token/create`. If the user is eligible for digital verification, providing the `precheck_id` in this way will generate a Link UI optimized for the end user and their specific employer. If the user cannot be confirmed as eligible, the `precheck_id` can still be provided to `/link/token/create` and the user can still use the income verification flow, but they may be required to manually upload a paystub to verify their income.

        While all request fields are optional, providing either `employer` or `transactions_access_tokens` data will increase the chance of receiving a useful result.

        This endpoint has been deprecated; new integrations should use `/credit/payroll_income/precheck` instead.

        Returns a JSON response containing details on all financial institutions currently supported by Plaid. Because Plaid supports thousands of institutions, results are paginated.

        If there is no overlap between an institution’s enabled products and a client’s enabled products, then the institution will be filtered out from the response. As a result, the number of institutions returned may not match the count specified in the call.

        Versioning note: API versions 2019-05-29 and earlier allow use of the `public_key` parameter instead of the `client_id` and `secret` to authenticate to this endpoint. The `public_key` has been deprecated; all customers are encouraged to use `client_id` and `secret` instead.

        Versioning note: API versions 2019-05-29 and earlier allow use of the `public_key` parameter instead of the `client_id` and `secret` parameters to authenticate to this endpoint. The `public_key` parameter has since been deprecated; all customers are encouraged to use `client_id` and `secret` instead.

    post:
      description: |-
        The `/investments/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to retrieve up to 24 months of user-authorized transaction data for investment accounts.

        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.

        Due to the potentially large number of investment transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and offset parameters in conjunction with the `total_investment_transactions` response body field to fetch all available investment transactions.

        Note that Investments does not have a webhook to indicate when initial transaction data has loaded. Instead, if transactions data is not ready when `/investments/transactions/get` is first called, Plaid will wait for the data. For this reason, calling `/investments/transactions/get` immediately after Link may take up to one to two minutes to return.

        By default, the `access_token` associated with an Item does not expire and should be stored in a persistent, secure manner.

        You can use the `/item/access_token/invalidate` endpoint to rotate the `access_token` associated with an Item. The endpoint returns a new `access_token` and immediately invalidates the previous `access_token`.

        `/item/import` creates an Item via your Plaid Exchange Integration and returns an `access_token`. As part of an `/item/import` request, you will include a User ID (`user_auth.user_id`) and Authentication Token (`user_auth.auth_token`) that enable data aggregation through your Plaid Exchange API endpoints. These authentication principals are to be chosen by you.

        Upon creating an Item via `/item/import`, Plaid will automatically begin an extraction of that Item through the Plaid Exchange infrastructure you have already integrated. This will automatically generate the Plaid native account ID for the account the user will switch their direct deposit to (`target_account_id`).

        Note: As of July 2020, the `/item/public_token/create` endpoint is deprecated. Instead, use `/link/token/create` with an `access_token` to create a Link token for use with [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode).

        If you need your user to take action to restore or resolve an error associated with an Item, generate a public token with the `/item/public_token/create` endpoint and then initialize Link with that `public_token`.

        A `public_token` is one-time use and expires after 30 minutes. You use a `public_token` to initialize Link in [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) for a particular Item. You can generate a `public_token` for an Item even if you did not use Link to create the Item originally.

        The `/item/public_token/create` endpoint is **not** used to create your initial `public_token`. If you have not already received an `access_token` for a specific Item, use Link to obtain your `public_token` instead. See the [Quickstart](https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart) for more information.

        Exchange a Link `public_token` for an API `access_token`. Link hands off the `public_token` client-side via the `onSuccess` callback once a user has successfully created an Item. The `public_token` is ephemeral and expires after 30 minutes. An `access_token` does not expire, but can be revoked by calling `/item/remove`.

        The response also includes an `item_id` that should be stored with the `access_token`. The `item_id` is used to identify an Item in a webhook. The `item_id` can also be retrieved by making an `/item/get` request.

      description: |-
        The `/item/remove` endpoint allows you to remove an Item. Once removed, the `access_token`, as well as any processor tokens or bank account tokens associated with the Item, is no longer valid and cannot be used to access any data that was associated with the Item.

        Note that in the Development environment, issuing an `/item/remove`  request will not decrement your live credential count. To increase your credential account in Development, contact Support.

        Also note that for certain OAuth-based institutions, an Item removed via `/item/remove` may still show as an active connection in the institution's OAuth permission manager.

        API versions 2019-05-29 and earlier return a `removed` boolean as part of the response.

  /liabilities/get:
    post:
      description: |-
        The `/liabilities/get` endpoint returns various details about an Item with loan or credit accounts. Liabilities data is available primarily for US financial institutions, with some limited coverage of Canadian institutions. Currently supported account types are account type `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`. To limit accounts listed in Link to types and subtypes supported by Liabilities, you can use the `account_filters` parameter when [creating a Link token](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate).

        The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the latest data can be retrieved by calling `/liabilities/get`.

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `liabilities` was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the additional data.

        Exchange an OAuth `link_correlation_id` for the corresponding `link_token`. The `link_correlation_id` is only available for 'payment_initiation' products and is provided to the client via the OAuth `redirect_uri` as a query parameter.
        The `link_correlation_id` is ephemeral and expires in a brief period, after which it can no longer be exchanged for the 'link_token'.

        The `/link/token/create` endpoint creates a `link_token`, which is required as a parameter when initializing Link. Once Link has been initialized, it returns a `public_token`, which can then be exchanged for an `access_token` via `/item/public_token/exchange` as part of the main Link flow.

        A `link_token` generated by `/link/token/create` is also used to initialize other Link flows, such as the update mode flow for tokens with expired credentials, or the Payment Initiation (Europe) flow.

        The `/payment_initiation/consent/create` endpoint is used to create a payment consent, which can be used to initiate payments on behalf of the user. Payment consents are created with `UNAUTHORISED` status by default and must be authorised by the user before payments can be initiated.

        Consents can be limited in time and scope, and have constraints that describe limitations for payments.

        After creating a payment recipient, you can use the `/payment_initiation/payment/create` endpoint to create a payment to that recipient.  Payments can be one-time or standing order (recurring) and can be denominated in either EUR, GBP or other chosen [currency](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiation-payment-create-request-amount-currency).  If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer, GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network and for non-Eurozone markets typically via the local payment scheme, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer or other local payment schemes will typically arrive in one business day.

        Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.

        In the Development environment, payments must be below 5 GBP or other chosen [currency](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiation-payment-create-request-amount-currency). For details on any payment limits in Production, contact your Plaid Account Manager.

        Reverse a settled payment from a Plaid virtual account.

        The original payment must be in a settled state to be refunded.
        To refund partially, specify the amount as part of the request.
        If the amount is not specified, the refund amount will be equal to all
        of the remaining payment amount that has not been refunded yet.
        If the remaining amount is less than one unit of currency
        (e.g. 1 GBP or 1 EUR), the refund will fail.

        The refund will go back to the source account that initiated the payment.
        The original payment must have been initiated to a Plaid virtual account
        so that this account can be used to initiate the refund.

        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` endpoint has been deprecated. New Plaid customers will be unable to use this endpoint, and existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the newer, `link_token`-based flow. The recommended flow is to provide the `payment_id` to `/link/token/create`, which returns a `link_token` used to initialize Link.

        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` is used to create a `payment_token`, which can then be used in Link initialization to enter a payment initiation flow. You can only use a `payment_token` once. If this attempt fails, the end user aborts the flow, or the token expires, you will need to create a new payment token. Creating a new payment token does not require end user input.

      description: |
        Create a payment recipient for payment initiation.  The recipient must be in Europe, within a country that is a member of the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) or a non-Eurozone country [supported](https://plaid.com/global) by Plaid. For a standing order (recurring) payment, the recipient must be in the UK.

        It is recommended to use `bacs` in the UK and `iban` in EU.

        The endpoint is idempotent: if a developer has already made a request with the same payment details, Plaid will return the same `recipient_id`.

        Use `/payment_profile/create` endpoint to create a new payment profile.
        To initiate the account linking experience, call `/link/token/create` and provide the `payment_profile_token` in the `transfer.payment_profile_token` field.
        You can then use the `payment_profile_token` when creating transfers using `/transfer/authorization/create` and `/transfer/create`.

      description: |-
        Use `/processor/signal/evaluate` to evaluate a planned ACH transaction as a processor to get a return risk assessment (such as a risk score and risk tier) and additional risk signals.

        In order to obtain a valid score for an ACH transaction, Plaid must have an access token for the account, and the Item must be healthy (receiving product updates) or have recently been in a healthy state. If the transaction does not meet eligibility requirements, an error will be returned corresponding to the underlying cause. If `/processor/signal/evaluate` is called on the same transaction multiple times within a 24-hour period, cached results may be returned. For more information please refer to our error documentation on [item errors](/docs/errors/item/) and [Link in Update Mode](/docs/link/update-mode/).

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if Signal is being added to an existing Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution when retrieving the data for the first time.

        Used to create a token suitable for sending to Stripe to enable Plaid-Stripe integrations. For a detailed guide on integrating Stripe, see [Add Stripe to your app](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/stripe/).

        Note that the Stripe bank account token is a one-time use token. To store bank account information for later use, you can use a Stripe customer object and create an associated bank account from the token, or you can use a Stripe Custom account and create an associated external bank account from the token. This bank account information should work indefinitely, unless the user's bank account information changes or they revoke Plaid's permissions to access their account. Stripe bank account information cannot be modified once the bank account token has been created. If you ever need to change the bank account details used by Stripe for a specific customer, have the user go through Link again and create a new bank account token from the new `access_token`.

        Bank account tokens can also be revoked, using `/item/remove`.'

Note that Stripe partnerships use bank account tokens instead; see `/processor/stripe/bank_account_token/create` for creating tokens for use with Stripe integrations. Once created, a processor token for a given Item cannot be modified or updated.

        The `/sandbox/item/fire_webhook` endpoint is used to test that code correctly handles webhooks. This endpoint can trigger the following webhooks:

        `DEFAULT_UPDATE`: Transactions update webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item. If the Item does not support Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.

        `NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`: Webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item created with Account Select v2.

        `AUTH_DATA_UPDATE`: Webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item created with Auth as an enabled product.

        `RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`: Recurring Transactions webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item. If the Item does not support Recurring Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.

        `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`: Transactions webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item.  If the Item does not support Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.

        Note that this endpoint is provided for developer ease-of-use and is not required for testing webhooks; webhooks will also fire in Sandbox under the same conditions that they would in Production or Development.

  /sandbox/item/reset_login:

        `/sandbox/item/reset_login/` forces an Item into an `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` state in order to simulate an Item whose login is no longer valid. This makes it easy to test Link's [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) flow in the Sandbox environment.  After calling `/sandbox/item/reset_login`, You can then use Plaid Link update mode to restore the Item to a good state. An `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` webhook will also be fired after a call to this endpoint, if one is associated with the Item.


        In the Sandbox, Items will transition to an `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` error state automatically after 30 days, even if this endpoint is not called.

        `/sandbox/payment_profile/reset_login/` forces a Payment Profile into a state where the login is no longer valid. This makes it easy to test update mode for Payment Profile in the Sandbox environment.

         After calling `/sandbox/payment_profile/reset_login`, calls to the `/transfer/authorization/create` with the Payment Profile will result in a `decision_rationale` `PAYMENT_PROFILE_LOGIN_REQUIRED`. You can then use update mode for Payment Profile to restore it into a good state.

         In order to invoke this endpoint, you must first [create a Payment Profile](https://plaid.com/docs/transfer/add-to-app/#create-a-payment-profile-optional) and [go through the Link flow](https://plaid.com/docs/transfer/add-to-app/#create-a-link-token).

    post:
      description: |-
        Use the `/sandbox/transfer/test_clock/advance` endpoint to advance a `test_clock` in the Sandbox environment.

        A test clock object represents an independent timeline and has a `virtual_time` field indicating the current timestamp of the timeline. A test clock can be advanced by incrementing `virtual_time`, but may never go back to a lower `virtual_time`.

        If a test clock is advanced, we will simulate the changes that ought to occur during the time that elapsed.
        For instance, a client creates a weekly recurring transfer with a test clock set at t. When the client advances the test clock by setting `virtual_time` = t + 15 days, 2 new originations should be created, along with the webhook events.

        The advancement of the test clock from its current `virtual_time` should be limited such that there are no more than 20 originations resulting from the advance operation on each `recurring_transfer` associated with the `test_clock`.
        For instance, if the recurring transfer associated with this test clock originates once every 4 weeks, you can advance the `virtual_time` up to 80 weeks on each API call.

    post:
      description: |-
        Use `/signal/evaluate` to evaluate a planned ACH transaction to get a return risk assessment (such as a risk score and risk tier) and additional risk signals.

        In order to obtain a valid score for an ACH transaction, Plaid must have an access token for the account, and the Item must be healthy (receiving product updates) or have recently been in a healthy state. If the transaction does not meet eligibility requirements, an error will be returned corresponding to the underlying cause. If `/signal/evaluate` is called on the same transaction multiple times within a 24-hour period, cached results may be returned. For more information please refer to the error documentation on [Item errors](/docs/errors/item/) and [Link in Update Mode](/docs/link/update-mode/).

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if Signal is being added to an existing Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution when retrieving the data for the first time.

        When Link is not initialized with Signal, call `/signal/prepare` to opt-in that Item to the Signal data collection process, developing a Signal score.

        If you are using other Plaid products after Link, e.g. Identity or Assets, call `/signal/prepare` after those product calls are complete.

        Example flow: Link is initialized with Auth, call `/auth/get` for the account and routing number, call `/identity/get` to retrieve bank ownership details, then call `/signal/prepare` to begin Signal data collection. Later, once you have obtained details about the proposed transaction from the user, call `/signal/evaluate` for a Signal score. For more information please see [Recommendations for initializing Link with specific product combinations](https://www.plaid.com/docs/link/initializing-products/#recommendations-for-initializing-link-with-specific-product-combinations).

      description: |-
        The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.

        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).

        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.

        Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.

        Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

        The `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.

        This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

        This endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/transactions/get`). After the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook has fired, call `/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook.

        After the initial call, you can call `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

      description: |-
        `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur multiple times a day for any Transactions-enabled Item. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/transactions/sync` and `/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`. Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) and will result in a `PRODUCT_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item from that institution. 

        `/transactions/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

        This endpoint replaces `/transactions/get` and its associated webhooks for most common use-cases.

        The `/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen. `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates.

        This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.

        Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.

        In the first call to `/transactions/sync` for an Item, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up until the time of the API call (as "adds"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.

        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.

        When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/transactions/sync` fails when retrieving a paginated update, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.

        Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.

        Note that for newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.

        To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.

        Use the `/transfer/authorization/create` endpoint to determine transfer failure risk.

        In Plaid's Sandbox environment the decisions will be returned as follows:

          - To approve a transfer with null rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.

          - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).

          - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).

          - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.

          - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.

        `device.ip_address`, `device.user_agent` are required fields.

        For [Guarantee](https://www.plaid.com/docs//transfer/guarantee/), the following fields are required : `idempotency_key`, `user.phone_number` (optional if `email_address` provided), `user.email_address` (optional if `phone_number` provided), `device.ip_address`, `device.user_agent`, and `user_present`.

  /transfer/migrate_account:
    post:
      description: As an alternative to adding Items via Link, you can also use the `/transfer/migrate_account` endpoint to migrate known account and routing numbers to Plaid Items.  Note that Items created in this way are not compatible with endpoints for other products, such as `/accounts/balance/get`, and can only be used with Transfer endpoints.  If you require access to other endpoints, create the Item through Link instead.  Access to `/transfer/migrate_account` is not enabled by default; to obtain access, contact your Plaid Account Manager.

        Use the `/transfer/refund/create` endpoint to create a refund for a transfer. A transfer can be refunded if the transfer was initiated in the past 180 days.

        Processing of the refund will not occur until at least 3 business days following the transfer's settlement date, plus any hold/settlement delays. This 3-day window helps better protect your business from regular ACH returns. Consumer initiated returns (unauthorized returns) could still happen for about 60 days from the settlement date. If the original transfer is canceled, returned or failed, all pending refunds will automatically be canceled. Processed refunds cannot be revoked.

        This endpoint should be called for each of your end users before they begin a Plaid income flow. This provides you a single token to access all income data associated with the user. You should only create one per end user.

        If you call the endpoint multiple times with the same `client_user_id`, the first creation call will succeed and the rest will fail with an error message indicating that the user has been created for the given `client_user_id`.

        Ensure that you store the `user_token` along with your user's identifier in your database, as it is not possible to retrieve a previously created `user_token`.

        available:
          description: |-
            The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.

            For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.

            For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.

            For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.

            Note that not all institutions calculate the `available`  balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.

            Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.

            If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.

        current:
          description: |-
            The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.

            For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.

            For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.

            For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.

            Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get`.

            When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.

This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.

            The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.

            If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.

            Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

        Fired when an Item's historical transaction pull is completed and Plaid has prepared as much historical transaction data as possible for the Item. Once this webhook has been fired, transaction data beyond the most recent 30 days can be fetched for the Item. If [Account Select v2](https://plaid.com/docs/link/customization/#account-select) is enabled, this webhook will also be fired if account selections for the Item are updated, with `new_transactions` set to the number of net new transactions pulled after the account selection update.

        This webhook is intended for use with `/transactions/get`; if you are using the newer `/transactions/sync` endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook instead.

        Specifically, these fields are optional in that they can either be fully provided (satisfying every required field in their subschema) or omitted from the request entirely by not providing the key or value.
        Providing these fields via the API will result in Link skipping the data collection process for the associated user. All verification steps enabled in the associated Identity Verification Template will still be run. Verification steps will either be run immediately, or once the user completes the `accept_tos` step, depending on the value provided to the `gave_consent` field.

        Note:


        This field must be provided when the retry strategy is `custom` and must be omitted otherwise.

        Custom retries override settings in your Plaid Template. For example, if your Plaid Template has `verify_sms` disabled, a custom retry with `verify_sms` enabled will still require the step.

        The `selfie_check` step is currently not supported on the sandbox server. Sandbox requests will silently disable the `selfie_check` step when provided.

        `failed` - The user failed one or more steps in the session and was told to contact support.

        `expired` - The Identity Verification attempt was active for a long period of time without being completed and was automatically marked as expired. Note that sessions currently do not expire. Automatic expiration is expected to be enabled in the future.

        `canceled` - The Identity Verification attempt was canceled, either via the dashboard by a user, or via API. The user may have completed part of the session, but has neither failed or passed.

        `pending_review` - The Identity Verification attempt template was configured to perform a screening that had one or more hits needing review.

        `active` - This step is the user's current step. They are either in the process of completing this step, or they recently closed their Identity Verification attempt while in the middle of this step. Only one step will be marked as `active` at any given point.

        `success` - The Identity Verification attempt has completed this step.

        `failed` - The user failed this step. This can either call the user to fail the session as a whole, or cause them to fallback to another step depending on how the Identity Verification template is configured. A failed step does not imply a failed session.

        `waiting_for_prerequisite` - The user needs to complete another step first, before they progress to this step. This step may never run, depending on if the user fails an earlier step or if the step is only run as a fallback.

        `not_applicable` - This step will not be run for this session.

        `skipped` - The retry instructions that created this Identity Verification attempt specified that this step should be skipped.

        `expired` - This step had not yet been completed when the Identity Verification attempt as a whole expired.

        `canceled` - The Identity Verification attempt was canceled before the user completed this step.

        `pending_review` - The Identity Verification attempt template was configured to perform a screening that had one or more hits needing review.

        `manually_approved` - The step was manually overridden to pass by a team member in the dashboard.

If there is not enough traffic to accurately calculate an institution's status, Plaid will return null rather than potentially inaccurate data.

        Institution status is accessible in the Dashboard and via the API using the `/institutions/get_by_id` endpoint with the `include_status` option set to true. Note that institution status is not available in the Sandbox environment.

You can further limit the accounts shown in Link by using `account_filters` to specify the account subtypes to be shown in Link. Only the specified subtypes will be shown. This filtering applies to both the Account Select view (if enabled) and the Institution Select view. Institutions that do not support the selected subtypes will be omitted from Link. To indicate that all subtypes should be shown, use the value `"all"`. If the `account_filters` filter is used, any account type for which a filter is not specified will be entirely omitted from Link. For a full list of valid types and subtypes, see the [Account schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#account-type-schema).

        For institutions using OAuth, the filter will not affect the list of accounts shown by the bank in the OAuth window.

To gain access to European institutions in the Production environment, [file a product access Support ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/product-troubleshooting/request-product-access) via the Plaid dashboard. If you initialize with a European country code, your users will see the European consent panel during the Link flow.

            List of Plaid product(s) you wish to use. If launching Link in update mode, should be omitted; required otherwise.

            `balance` is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require explicit initialization and will automatically be initialized when any other product is initialized.

            The products specified here will determine which institutions will be available to your users in Link. Only institutions that support *all* requested products can be selected; a if a user attempts to select an institution that does not support a listed product, a "Connectivity not supported" error message will appear in Link. To maximize the number of institutions available, initialize Link with the minimal product set required for your use case. Additional products can be added after Link initialization by calling the relevant endpoints. For details and exceptions, see [Choosing when to initialize products](https://plaid.com/docs/link/initializing-products/).

            Note that, unless you have opted to disable Instant Match support, institutions that support Instant Match will also be shown in Link if `auth` is specified as a product, even though these institutions do not contain `auth` in their product array.

            In Production, you will be billed for each product that you specify when initializing Link. Note that a product cannot be removed from an Item once the Item has been initialized with that product. To stop billing on an Item for subscription-based products, such as Liabilities, Investments, and Transactions, remove the Item via `/item/remove`.

    LinkTokenCreateRequestAccountSubtypes:
      description: |
        By default, Link will only display account types that are compatible with all products supplied in the `products` parameter of `/link/token/create`. You can further limit the accounts shown in Link by using `account_filters` to specify the account subtypes to be shown in Link. Only the specified subtypes will be shown. This filtering applies to both the Account Select view (if enabled) and the Institution Select view. Institutions that do not support the selected subtypes will be omitted from Link. To indicate that all subtypes should be shown, use the value `"all"`. If the `account_filters` filter is used, any account type for which a filter is not specified will be entirely omitted from Link.

        For a full list of valid types and subtypes, see the [Account schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#account-type-schema).

        For institutions using OAuth, the filter will not affect the list of institutions or accounts shown by the bank in the OAuth window.

            Note that when using OAuth with Chase Bank (`ins_56`), Chase will issue "tokenized" routing and account numbers, which are not the user's actual account and routing numbers. These tokenized numbers should work identically to normal account and routing numbers. The digits returned in the `mask` field will continue to reflect the actual account number, rather than the tokenized account number; for this reason, when displaying account numbers to the user to help them identify their account in your UI, always use the `mask` rather than truncating the `account` number. If a user revokes their permissions to your app, the tokenized numbers will continue to work for ACH deposits, but not withdrawals.

        `balanced` - A good default for most companies. This sensitivity is balanced to show high quality hits with reduced noise.

        `strict` - Aggressive false positive reduction. This sensitivity will require names to be more similar than `coarse` and `balanced` settings, relying less on phonetics, while still accounting for character transpositions, missing tokens, and other common permutations.

        `exact` - Matches must be nearly exact. This sensitivity will only show hits with exact or nearly exact name matches with only basic correction such as extraneous symbols and capitalization. This setting is generally not recommended unless you have a very specific use case.

    SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook:

      description: |-
        Fired when an Item's transactions change. This can be due to any event resulting in new changes, such as an initial 30-day transactions fetch upon the initialization of an Item with transactions, the backfill of historical transactions that occurs shortly after, or when changes are populated from a regularly-scheduled transactions update job. It is recommended to listen for the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook when using the `/transactions/sync` endpoint. Note that when using `/transactions/sync` the older webhooks `INITIAL_UPDATE`, `HISTORICAL_UPDATE`, `DEFAULT_UPDATE`, and `TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`, which are intended for use with `/transactions/get`, will also continue to be sent in order to maintain backwards compatibility. It is not necessary to listen for and respond to those webhooks when using `/transactions/sync`.

        After receipt of this webhook, the new changes can be fetched for the Item from `/transactions/sync`.

        Note that to receive this webhook for an Item, `/transactions/sync` must have been called at least once on that Item. This means that, unlike the `INITIAL_UPDATE` and `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhooks, it will not fire immediately upon Item creation. If `/transactions/sync` is called on an Item that was *not* initialized with Transactions, the webhook will fire twice: once the first 30 days of transactions data has been fetched, and a second time when all available historical transactions data has been fetched.

        This webhook will typically not fire in the Sandbox environment, due to the lack of dynamic transactions data. To test this webhook in Sandbox, call `/sandbox/item/fire_webhook`.

    TransferSweep:

      description: |-
        Describes a sweep of funds to / from the sweep account.

        A sweep is associated with many sweep events (events of type `swept` or `return_swept`) which can be retrieved by invoking the `/transfer/event/list` endpoint with the corresponding `sweep_id`.

        `swept` events occur when the transfer amount is credited or debited from your sweep account, depending on the `type` of the transfer. `return_swept` events occur when a transfer is returned and Plaid undoes the credit or debit.

        The total sum of the `swept` and `return_swept` events is equal to the `amount` of the sweep Plaid creates and matches the amount of the entry on your sweep account ledger.
      properties:
        amount:
