  - description: Accounts are your bank accounts with Increase. They store money, receive transfers, and send payments. They earn interest and have depository insurance.
    name: Accounts
  - description: Each account can have multiple account and routing numbers. We recommend that you use a set per vendor. This is similar to how you use different passwords for different websites. Account numbers can also be used to seamlessly reconcile inbound payments. Generating a unique account number per vendor ensures you always know the originator of an incoming payment.
    name: Account Numbers
  - description: Cards are commercial credit cards. They'll immediately work for online purchases after you create them. All cards maintain a credit limit of 100% of the Accountâ€™s available balance at the time of transaction. Funds are deducted from the Account upon transaction settlement.
    name: Cards
  - description: If unauthorized activity occurs on a card, you can create a Card Dispute and we'll return the funds if appropriate.
    name: Card Disputes
  - description: This contains artwork and metadata relating to a Card's appearance in digital wallet apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay. For more information, see our guide on [digital card artwork](https://increase.com/documentation/card-art)

    name: Declined Transactions
  - description: You can set limits at the Account, Account Number, or Card level. Limits applied to Accounts will apply to all Account Numbers and Cards in the Account. You can specify any number of Limits and they will all be applied to inbound debits and card authorizations. Volume and count Limits are designed to prevent unauthorized debits.
    name: Limits
  - description: Account transfers move funds between your own accounts at Increase.
    name: Account Transfers
  - description: ACH transfers move funds between your Increase account and any other account accessible by the Automated Clearing House (ACH).
    name: ACH Transfers
  - description: ACH Prenotifications are one way you can verify account and routing numbers by Automated Clearing House (ACH).
    name: ACH Prenotifications
  - description: If unauthorized activity occurs via ACH, you can create an Inbound ACH Transfer Return and we'll reverse the transaction. You can create an Inbound ACH Transfer return the first two days after receiving an Inbound ACH Transfer.
    name: Inbound ACH Transfer Returns
  - description: Wire transfers move funds between your Increase account and any other account accessible by Fedwire.
    name: Wire Transfers
  - description: Wire drawdown requests enable you to request that someone else send you a wire. This feature is in beta; reach out to [support@increase.com](mailto:support@increase.com) to learn more.
    name: Wire Drawdown Requests
  - description: Inbound wire drawdown requests are requests from someone else to send them a wire. This feature is in beta; reach out to [support@increase.com](mailto:support@increase.com) to learn more.

    name: Check Deposits
  - description: Routing numbers are used to identify your bank in a financial transaction.
    name: Routing Numbers
  - description: External Accounts represent accounts at financial institutions other than Increase. You can use this API to store their details for reuse.
    name: External Accounts
  - description: Entities are the legal entities that own accounts. They can be people, corporations, partnerships, or trusts.
    name: Entities
  - description: Account Statements are generated monthly for every active Account. You can access the statement's data via the API or retrieve a PDF with its details via its associated File.
    name: Account Statements
  - description: Files are objects that represent a file hosted on Increase's servers. The file may have been uploaded by you (for example, when uploading a check image) or it may have been created by Increase (for example, an autogenerated statement PDF).
    name: Files
  - description: Increase generates certain documents / forms automatically for your application; they can be listed here. Currently the only supported document type is IRS Form 1099-INT.
    name: Documents
  - description: Events are records of things that happened to objects in the API. They also result in webhooks being generated.
    name: Events
  - description: Webhooks are event notifications we send to you by HTTPS POST requests. Event Subscriptions are how you configure your application to listen for them. You can create an Event Subscription through your [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.increase.com/developers/webhooks) or the API. For more information, see our [webhooks guide](https://increase.com/documentation/webhooks).
    name: Event Subscriptions
  - description: Real Time Decisions are created when your application needs to take action in real-time to some event such as a card authorization. Real time decisions are currently in beta; please contact support@increase.com if you're interested in trying them out!
    name: Real-Time Decisions
  - description: Groups represent organizations using Increase. You can retrieve information about your own organization via the API, or (more commonly) OAuth platforms can retrieve information about the organizations that have granted them access.
    name: Groups
  - description: When a user authorizes your OAuth application, an OAuth Connection object is created.
    name: OAuth Connections
  - description: When building your application, you can use these APIs to simulate external effects. They can be helpful to quickly test events that might take several hours in the real world (like receiving a wire or ACH). *These APIs will only work in the sandbox.* If you have a sandbox [Event Subscription](#event-subscriptions) configured, calling these APIs will also result in the appropriate webhooks being sent to your endpoint.

          description: A description you choose to give the transfer. This will be saved with the transfer details, displayed in the dashboard, and returned by the API. If `individual_name` and `company_name` are not explicitly set by this API, the `statement_descriptor` will be sent in those fields to the receiving bank to help the customer recognize the transfer. You are highly encouraged to pass `individual_name` and `company_name` instead of relying on this fallback.
