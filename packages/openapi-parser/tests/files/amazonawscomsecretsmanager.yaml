  description: <fullname>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager</fullname> <p>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager provides a service to enable you to store, manage, and retrieve, secrets.</p> <p>This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html">Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>API Version</b> </p> <p>This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17.</p> <p>For a list of endpoints, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/asm_access.html#endpoints">Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager endpoints</a>.</p> <p> <b>Support and Feedback for Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager</b> </p> <p>We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a href="mailto:awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com">awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com</a>, or post your feedback and questions in the <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296">Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Discussion Forum</a>. For more information about the Amazon Web Services Discussion Forums, see <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa">Forums Help</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail">Logging Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</i>. To learn more about CloudTrail, including enabling it and find your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>

      description: "<p>Creates a new secret. A <i>secret</i> can be a password, a set of credentials such as a user name and password, an OAuth token, or other secret information that you store in an encrypted form in Secrets Manager. The secret also includes the connection information to access a database or other service, which Secrets Manager doesn't encrypt. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret.</p> <p>For secrets that use <i>managed rotation</i>, you need to create the secret through the managing service. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/service-linked-secrets.html\">Secrets Manager secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services services</a>. </p> <p>For information about creating a secret in the console, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html\">Create a secret</a>.</p> <p>To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in either the <code>SecretString</code> parameter or the <code>SecretBinary</code> parameter, but not both. If you include <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to it.</p> <p>For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the JSON you store in the <code>SecretString</code> matches the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_secret_json_structure.html\">JSON structure of a database secret</a>.</p> <p>If you don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key <code>aws/secretsmanager</code>. If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use <code>aws/secretsmanager</code>. Creating <code>aws/secretsmanager</code> can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.</p> <p>If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the API, then you can't use <code>aws/secretsmanager</code> to encrypt the secret, and you must create and use a customer managed KMS key. </p> <p>Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except <code>SecretBinary</code> or <code>SecretString</code> because it might be logged.

      description: "<p>Creates a new version with a new encrypted secret value and attaches it to the secret. The version can contain a new <code>SecretString</code> value or a new <code>SecretBinary</code> value. </p> <p>We recommend you avoid calling <code>PutSecretValue</code> at a sustained rate of more than once every 10 minutes. When you update the secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not remove versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you call <code>PutSecretValue</code> more than once every 10 minutes, you create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the quota for secret versions.</p> <p>You can specify the staging labels to attach to the new version in <code>VersionStages</code>. If you don't include <code>VersionStages</code>, then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to this version. If this operation creates the first version for the secret, then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to it. If this operation moves the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> from another version to this version, then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the staging label <code>AWSPREVIOUS</code> to the version that <code>AWSCURRENT</code> was removed from.</p> <p>This operation is idempotent. If you call this operation with a <code>ClientRequestToken</code> that matches an existing version's VersionId, and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing. However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails because you can't modify an existing version; you can only create new ones.</p> <p>Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action.
