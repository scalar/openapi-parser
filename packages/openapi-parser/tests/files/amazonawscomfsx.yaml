      description: "<p>Copies an existing backup within the same Amazon Web Services account to another Amazon Web Services Region (cross-Region copy) or within the same Amazon Web Services Region (in-Region copy). You can have up to five backup copy requests in progress to a single destination Region per account.</p> <p>You can use cross-Region backup copies for cross-Region disaster recovery. You can periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your Amazon Web Services partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. Amazon Web Services currently has three partitions: <code>aws</code> (Standard Regions), <code>aws-cn</code> (China Regions), and <code>aws-us-gov</code> (Amazon Web Services GovCloud [US] Regions).</p> <p>You can also use backup copies to clone your file dataset to another Region or within the same Region.</p> <p>You can use the <code>SourceRegion</code> parameter to specify the Amazon Web Services Region from which the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the <code>us-west-1</code> Region and want to copy a backup from the <code>us-east-2</code> Region, you specify <code>us-east-2</code> in the <code>SourceRegion</code> parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).</p> <p>For more information about creating backup copies, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html#copy-backups\"> Copying backups</a> in the <i>Amazon FSx for Windows User Guide</i>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html#copy-backups\">Copying backups</a> in the <i>Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide</i>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/using-backups.html#copy-backups\">Copying backups</a> in the <i>Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide</i>.</p>"

      description: <p>Creates a snapshot of an existing Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume. With snapshots, you can easily undo file changes and compare file versions by restoring the volume to a previous version.</p> <p>If a snapshot with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the existing snapshot. If a snapshot with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters don't match, this operation returns <code>IncompatibleParameterError</code>. If a snapshot with the specified client request token doesn't exist, <code>CreateSnapshot</code> does the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Creates a new OpenZFS snapshot with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of <code>CREATING</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Returns the description of the snapshot.</p> </li> </ul> <p>By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a <code>CreateSnapshot</code> operation without the risk of creating an extra snapshot. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a snapshot was created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a snapshot, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are the same.</p> <p>The <code>CreateSnapshot</code> operation returns while the snapshot's lifecycle state is still <code>CREATING</code>. You can check the snapshot creation status by calling the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSnapshots.html">DescribeSnapshots</a> operation, which returns the snapshot state along with other information.</p>
