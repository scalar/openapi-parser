  title: AWS WAFV2
  description: "<fullname>WAF</fullname> <note> <p>This is the latest version of the <b>WAF</b> API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like \"V2\" or \"v2\", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements.</p> <p>If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. </p> <p>For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html\">WAF Developer Guide</a>. </p> </note> <p>WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, or App Runner service. WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response. </p> <p>This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using WAF, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html\">WAF Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html\">WAF endpoints and quotas</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <p>For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, or an App Runner service. </p> </li> <li> <p>For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs\">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p> <p>We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.</p> </li> </ul>"

      description: <p>Associates a web ACL with a regional application resource, to protect the resource. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, or an App Runner service. </p> <p>For Amazon CloudFront, don't use this call. Instead, use your CloudFront distribution configuration. To associate a web ACL, in the CloudFront call <code>UpdateDistribution</code>, set the web ACL ID to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html">UpdateDistribution</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>When you make changes to web ACLs or web ACL components, like rules and rule groups, WAF propagates the changes everywhere that the web ACL and its components are stored and used. Your changes are applied within seconds, but there might be a brief period of inconsistency when the changes have arrived in some places and not in others. So, for example, if you change a rule action setting, the action might be the old action in one area and the new action in another area. Or if you add an IP address to an IP set used in a blocking rule, the new address might briefly be blocked in one area while still allowed in another. This temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate a web ACL with an Amazon Web Services resource and when you change a web ACL that is already associated with a resource. Generally, any inconsistencies of this type last only a few seconds.</p>

      description: <p>Returns the web ACL capacity unit (WCU) requirements for a specified scope and set of rules. You can use this to check the capacity requirements for the rules you want to use in a <a>RuleGroup</a> or <a>WebACL</a>. </p> <p>WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group.

For example, if you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use the rule group in a web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for that web ACL, rule group reference statement, and rate-based rule instance. If you use the same rule group in a second web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for this second usage completely independent of your first. </p>

So, for example, if you change a rule action setting, the action might be the old action in one area and the new action in another area. Or if you add an IP address to an IP set used in a blocking rule, the new address might briefly be blocked in one area while still allowed in another. This temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate a web ACL with an Amazon Web Services resource and when you change a web ACL that is already associated with a resource. Generally, any inconsistencies of this type last only a few seconds.</p> <p> A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web requests that you can use in a <a>WebACL</a>. When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements. </p>"

For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.</p> <p>You cannot nest a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside another statement, for example inside a <code>NotStatement</code> or <code>OrStatement</code>.

      description: <p>A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests. </p> <p>WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF. </p> <p>When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.</p> <p>You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An IP match statement with an IP set that specifies the address 192.0.2.44.</p> </li> <li> <p>A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for the string BadBot.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.</p> <p>You cannot nest a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside another statement, for example inside a <code>NotStatement</code> or <code>OrStatement</code>. You can define a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside a web ACL and inside a rule group. </p>
