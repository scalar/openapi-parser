  title: AWS Resource Access Manager
  description: <p>This is the <i>Resource Access Manager API Reference</i>. This documentation provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources to other Amazon Web Services accounts. If you use Organizations to manage your accounts, then you can share your resources with your entire organization or to organizational units (OUs). For supported resource types, you can also share resources with individual Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users. </p> <p>To learn more about RAM, see the following resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ram">Resource Access Manager product page</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/">Resource Access Manager User Guide</a> </p> </li> </ul>

You can optionally specify that the update applies to only resource shares that currently use a specified version. This enables you to update to the latest version, without changing the which managed permission is used.</p> <p>You can use this operation to update all of your resource shares to use the current default version of the permission by specifying the same value for the <code>fromPermissionArn</code> and <code>toPermissionArn</code> parameters.</p> <p>You can use the optional <code>fromPermissionVersion</code> parameter to update only those resources that use a specified version of the managed permission to the new managed permission.</p> <important> <p>To successfully perform this operation, you must have permission to update the resource-based policy on all affected resource types.</p> </important>
