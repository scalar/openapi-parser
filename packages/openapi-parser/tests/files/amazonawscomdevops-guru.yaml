  title: Amazon DevOps Guru
  description: <p> Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify anomalous behavior in business critical operational applications. You specify the Amazon Web Services resources that you want DevOps Guru to cover, then the Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon Web Services CloudTrail events related to those resources are analyzed. When anomalous behavior is detected, DevOps Guru creates an <i>insight</i> that includes recommendations, related events, and related metrics that can help you improve your operational applications. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html">What is Amazon DevOps Guru</a>. </p> <p> You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you are notified every time a new insight is created. You can also enable DevOps Guru to generate an OpsItem in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for each insight to help you manage and track your work addressing insights. </p> <p> To learn about the DevOps Guru workflow, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html#how-it-works">How DevOps Guru works</a>. To learn about DevOps Guru concepts, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/concepts.html">Concepts in DevOps Guru</a>. </p>

                        - description: <p>The Amazon Web Services tags used to filter the resource collection that is used for a cost estimate.</p> <p>Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more information about using tags, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html">Tagging best practices</a> whitepaper. </p> <p>Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts. </p> <ul> <li> <p>A tag <i>key</i> (for example, <code>CostCenter</code>, <code>Environment</code>, <code>Project</code>, or <code>Secret</code>). Tag <i>keys</i> are case-sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional field known as a tag <i>value</i> (for example, <code>111122223333</code>, <code>Production</code>, or a team name). Omitting the tag <i>value</i> is the same as using an empty string. Like tag <i>keys</i>, tag <i>values</i> are case-sensitive.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Together these are known as <i>key</i>-<i>value</i> pairs.</p> <important> <p>The string used for a <i>key</i> in a tag that you use to define your resource coverage must begin with the prefix <code>Devops-guru-</code>. The tag <i>key</i> might be <code>DevOps-Guru-deployment-application</code> or <code>devops-guru-rds-application</code>. When you create a <i>key</i>, the case of characters in the <i>key</i> can be whatever you choose. After you create a <i>key</i>, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a <i>key</i> named <code>devops-guru-rds</code> and a <i>key</i> named <code>DevOps-Guru-RDS</code>, and these act as two different <i>keys</i>. Possible <i>key</i>/<i>value</i> pairs in your application might be <code>Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS</code> or <code>Devops-Guru-production-application/containers</code>.</p> </important>

For more information about using tags, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html">Tagging best practices</a> whitepaper. </p> <p>Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts. </p> <ul> <li> <p>A tag <i>key</i> (for example, <code>CostCenter</code>, <code>Environment</code>, <code>Project</code>, or <code>Secret</code>). Tag <i>keys</i> are case-sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional field known as a tag <i>value</i> (for example, <code>111122223333</code>, <code>Production</code>, or a team name). Omitting the tag <i>value</i> is the same as using an empty string. Like tag <i>keys</i>, tag <i>values</i> are case-sensitive.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Together these are known as <i>key</i>-<i>value</i> pairs.</p> <important> <p>The string used for a <i>key</i> in a tag that you use to define your resource coverage must begin with the prefix <code>Devops-guru-</code>. The tag <i>key</i> might be <code>DevOps-Guru-deployment-application</code> or <code>devops-guru-rds-application</code>. When you create a <i>key</i>, the case of characters in the <i>key</i> can be whatever you choose. After you create a <i>key</i>, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a <i>key</i> named <code>devops-guru-rds</code> and a <i>key</i> named <code>DevOps-Guru-RDS</code>, and these act as two different <i>keys</i>. Possible <i>key</i>/<i>value</i> pairs in your application might be <code>Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS</code> or <code>Devops-Guru-production-application/containers</code>.</p> </important>

Tag <i>keys</i> are case-sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional field known as a tag <i>value</i> (for example, <code>111122223333</code>, <code>Production</code>, or a team name). Omitting the tag <i>value</i> is the same as using an empty string. Like tag <i>keys</i>, tag <i>values</i> are case-sensitive.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Together these are known as <i>key</i>-<i>value</i> pairs.</p> <important> <p>The string used for a <i>key</i> in a tag that you use to define your resource coverage must begin with the prefix <code>Devops-guru-</code>. The tag <i>key</i> might be <code>DevOps-Guru-deployment-application</code> or <code>devops-guru-rds-application</code>. When you create a <i>key</i>, the case of characters in the <i>key</i> can be whatever you choose. After you create a <i>key</i>, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a <i>key</i> named <code>devops-guru-rds</code> and a <i>key</i> named <code>DevOps-Guru-RDS</code>, and these act as two different <i>keys</i>. Possible <i>key</i>/<i>value</i> pairs in your application might be <code>Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS</code> or <code>Devops-Guru-production-application/containers</code>.</p> </important>

Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more information about using tags, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html">Tagging best practices</a> whitepaper. </p> <p>Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts. </p> <ul> <li> <p>A tag <i>key</i> (for example, <code>CostCenter</code>, <code>Environment</code>, <code>Project</code>, or <code>Secret</code>). Tag <i>keys</i> are case-sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional field known as a tag <i>value</i> (for example, <code>111122223333</code>, <code>Production</code>, or a team name). Omitting the tag <i>value</i> is the same as using an empty string. Like tag <i>keys</i>, tag <i>values</i> are case-sensitive.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Together these are known as <i>key</i>-<i>value</i> pairs.</p> <important> <p>The string used for a <i>key</i> in a tag that you use to define your resource coverage must begin with the prefix <code>Devops-guru-</code>. The tag <i>key</i> might be <code>DevOps-Guru-deployment-application</code> or <code>devops-guru-rds-application</code>. When you create a <i>key</i>, the case of characters in the <i>key</i> can be whatever you choose. After you create a <i>key</i>, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a <i>key</i> named <code>devops-guru-rds</code> and a <i>key</i> named <code>DevOps-Guru-RDS</code>, and these act as two different <i>keys</i>. Possible <i>key</i>/<i>value</i> pairs in your application might be <code>Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS</code> or <code>Devops-Guru-production-application/containers</code>.</p> </important>

For more information about using tags, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html">Tagging best practices</a> whitepaper. </p> <p>Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts. </p> <ul> <li> <p>A tag <i>key</i> (for example, <code>CostCenter</code>, <code>Environment</code>, <code>Project</code>, or <code>Secret</code>). Tag <i>keys</i> are case-sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional field known as a tag <i>value</i> (for example, <code>111122223333</code>, <code>Production</code>, or a team name). Omitting the tag <i>value</i> is the same as using an empty string. Like tag <i>keys</i>, tag <i>values</i> are case-sensitive.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Together these are known as <i>key</i>-<i>value</i> pairs.</p> <important> <p>The string used for a <i>key</i> in a tag that you use to define your resource coverage must begin with the prefix <code>Devops-guru-</code>. The tag <i>key</i> might be <code>DevOps-Guru-deployment-application</code> or <code>devops-guru-rds-application</code>. When you create a <i>key</i>, the case of characters in the <i>key</i> can be whatever you choose. After you create a <i>key</i>, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a <i>key</i> named <code>devops-guru-rds</code> and a <i>key</i> named <code>DevOps-Guru-RDS</code>, and these act as two different <i>keys</i>. Possible <i>key</i>/<i>value</i> pairs in your application might be <code>Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS</code> or <code>Devops-Guru-production-application/containers</code>.</p> </important>
