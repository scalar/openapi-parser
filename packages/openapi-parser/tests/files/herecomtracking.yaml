      The ingestion service provides an interface for devices to do data ingestion to HERE Tracking.
      The ingested data is a device telemetry, which may include, for example, a GPS position, sensor readings,
      WLAN or Bluetooth scans.
      Only a provisioned and a claimed device data is accepted.

      Devices should use uniquely this interface to send data to HERE Tracking.

      The Largedata service is used for storing large data blobs from devices to
      HERE Tracking and retrieving the resulting assembled data from HERE Tracking by the users.

      The data upload from a device follows the multipart data upload pattern:

      * Create a new data upload.
      * Check that the upload status is no longer ***preparing***.
      * For each part:
      ** Upload the part.
      * Complete the upload after all parts have been uploaded.

      A data upload state can be one of the following:
      * ***preparing***: The storage for the data is being prepared.
      * ***pending***: Data upload has been succesfully created but no parts have been uploaded yet.
      * ***ongoing***: Data upload is ongoing.
      * ***completed***: Data upload has been successfully completed.
      * ***failed***: Data upload has failed.

      Data parts can be uploaded only if the upload state is one of the following: ***pending***, ***ongoing***, ***failed***. 
      Note that the state will be changed to ***failed*** if uploading a part fails, 
      but if the part is uploaded again successfully, the upload state is changed back to ***ongoing***.

      The data can be downloaded only if the upload state is ***completed***.

      The Registry service is used for provisioning and claiming devices.

      Device licenses can only be provisioned by a vendor.
      A vendor is a user who has a developer plan (evaluation or paid commercial) with HERE
      that has been enabled for device license creation.
      A user claiming a device is the device owner, which is different from the device vendor.
      Access to the data generated by the device is limited to the device owner only.

      An alias is an arbitrary `type` - `externalId` pair, which can be associated with a `trackingId`.

      The `externalId` can be, for example, an external management system asset ID or a human-readable name.
      An alias is uniquely identified by an `externalId` and a `type` pair within a tracking project.

      The Cloud to Cloud service is used to create and manage connections between external
      cloud providers and HERE Tracking.
      A connection is formed by creating a cloud-to-cloud connector which receives reports from
      the external cloud devices and transforms them into the HERE Tracking ingestions,
      thus enabling the external devices to be tracked by HERE Tracking.

      The Events service manages device and shipment events.

      An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion. 

      A geofence event is created every time a device enters or exits an associated geofence.
      A sensor event is created when sensor data reported by a device triggers a sensor rule. 
      A rule event (such as dwelling, detention, utilization, stock and online rule) is created when
      a device behaviour triggers a rule.

      The Geofences service creates and manages geofences.

      A geofence is an area boundary that users can define and associate with their devices.
      The area that the geofence encloses can be defined using geographic coordinates or radio measurements.

      Geographic geofences can be `circular` or `polygonal`. 
      A circular geofence is defined by geographic coordinates of its center and a radius, 
      while polygonal geofences are defined as a set of geographic coordinates.

      `POI geofence` (Point Of Interest) is a geofence, which is defined using radio measurements.
      POI geofences need to be trained separately using a telemetry that a device has recorded while 
      being at the desired point of interest. 

      Once created, a geofence can be associated to a device. 
      Every time a position or a radio measurement update is received from a device, 
      HERE Tracking would evaluate whether the device has transitioned across the boundary of 
      an associated geofence.
      If such a transition has happened, a transition event will be recorded.
      For the geographic geofences, the evaluation is based on the coordinates of the trace.
      For POI geofences, the device is considered to be inside a trained POI geofence when the radio 
      measurements of the device-ingested telemetry and the training data match.

      Indoor geofences can be created by adding the floor properties to the geofence definition.
      Circular and polygonal geofences can be both outdoors and indoors. 
      POI geofences should only be used indoors.
      For indoor geofences a device transition is recorded only if the position of the device is indoors 
      and the floor details of the position match the geofence floor definition.

      NOTE: A geofence can also be referred to as a geozone, and these two terms are interchangeable.

      The Labels service creates and manages labels.

      A label is a key-value pair that can be associated to the following resources:

      * device
      * geofence
      * sensor
      * rule
      * location
      * shipment

      One can list labels for a specific resource or resource type, and filter
      labels by keys or key-value pairs.
    name: Labels
  - description: |
      The Locations service creates and manages locations.

      This is an Alpha version of the Locations API and can still be changed in future releases.

      Locations are geographical points of interest users may store in HERE Tracking. Locations are
      used as building blocks for shipments.
    name: Locations

      The Metadata service creates and manages metadata.

      Metadata is a descriptive information added to a device, a shipment, a geofence or a sensor rule.
    name: Metadata
  - description: |
      The Notifications service provides a way to manage notification channels.

      Users need to register notification channels to get notified about new events.
      The supported notification channel types are webhook, 
      email and browser pull. Webhook notifications are common for all users in a project, but email and
      browser pull notification subscriptions are user-specific. 

      Email notifications will only be sent to a verified HERE Account email address.
      The browser pull notifications will be enabled for the [HERE Tracking Asset web](https://asset.tracking.here.com).
      For the webhook notifications, a URL registered as a webhook will receive a POST request on any
      matching event occurence.

      To get notified only about some specific events, users can apply various filters when subscribing to notifications, 
      specifying, for example, a particular rule ID or a geofence ID.
      If an occuring event matches `ruleId`, `eventSource`, `eventType` and `initialState` 
      filter settings, a notification gets triggerred.

      A single notification contains multiple matching event objects, for example:

      ```
      [
        {
          "eventType": "ABOVE_RANGE",
          "ruleId": "a3f652bc-a456-7f12-cd11-123ah761yt41",
          "ruleName": "My temperature rule"
          "eventSource": "temperature"
          "trackingId": "HERE-871eb4c9-76f6-4e9d-bed7-fa114f793e83",
          "timestamp": 1499258184356,
          "initialState": false
        },
        {
          "eventType": "INSIDE_GEOFENCE",
          "ruleId": "e2f651ee-f196-4fa3-bf88-894dc131dea3",
          "ruleName": "Warehouse 12345"
          "eventSource": "geofence"
          "trackingId": "HERE-871eb4c9-76f6-4e9d-bed7-fa114f793e83",
          "timestamp": 1499258184356,
          "initialState": false
        },
        {
          "eventType": "DWELLING_STARTED",
          "ruleId": "bf4510c0-ffa1-4ae3-8174-6a3474f7091e",
          "ruleName": "Dwelling 1 hour in a geofence"
          "eventSource": "dwelling"
          "trackingId": "HERE-871eb4c9-76f6-4e9d-bed7-fa114f793e83",
          "timestamp": 1499258184356,
          "geofenceId": "e2f651ee-f196-4fa3-bf88-894dc131dea3",
          "geofenceName": "Warehouse 12345"
          "initialState": false
        }
      ]
      ```

      If a device is offline, its notifications will not be sent to the user until the device is back online again.

      The Reports service provides a way to create and get reports related to event data.

      This is a tool for collecting and analyzing historical data of all devices of a project.
      The reports are created based on the event data generated by HERE Tracking `rules`.
      The supported rule types are:
      * dwelling
      * detention
      * utilization

      To be able to create a report, the user must have at least one rule of a supported type created
      and associated to a device.

      Once a report has been successfully created, the user will get the report ID, which can be used
      for various reports queries.

      > Note that in the report context a device is also referred to as an 'asset'.
    name: Reports
  - description: |
      The Rules service creates and manages rules. 

      Rules generate events and notifications when get triggered by a device behaviour.
      The following rule types are supported:
      * dwelling
      * detention
      * utilization
      * stock
      * online
      * shipmentSchedule

      After a rule has been created, it needs to be associated to a device to get activated.

      This association means that every time a telemetry is received from the device,
      it will be evaluated against the rule condition.
      As soon as the evaluation changes (for example, from true to false), an event will be recorded.
    name: Rules
  - description: |
      The Sensors service creates and manages sensor rules. 

      The sensor rules generate events and notifications when get triggered by a 
      reported device sensor reading.

      The following sensor rule types are supported:
      * battery
      * humidity
      * pressure
      * temperature
      * acceleration
      * attach
      * tamper

      After a sensor rule has been created, it needs to be associated to a device to get activated.

      This association means that every time a sensor update is received from the device as a part 
      of its ingestion telemetry, it will be evaluated against the sensor rule condition.
      As soon as the evaluation changes (for example, from true to false), an event will be recorded.
    name: Sensors
  - description: |
      The Shadows service provides an effective way to manage configurations 
      for devices that are only intermittently online.

      The device shadow contains `reported` and `desired` state objects of a device, 
      referred to as `reported` and `desired` shadows.

      The `desired` shadow contains configuration settings that the device should use and possibly also
      some optional custom settings. 
      The device receives the `desired` shadow from HERE Tracking as a response to the ingestion request.

      The `reported` shadow contains the most recent position, sensor readings and settings that the
      device has sent. The reported shadow may also contain additional properties generated by HERE 
      Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry. Such properties are stored in the `system.computed` 
      property.

      In case the most recent telemetry did not contain all the possible
      fields, the last known information will remain in the shadow. This means that one can
      see, for example, the last reported temperature or tracker firmware information in the reported shadow,
      even if the device did not send that information in the latest telemetry.

      > **IMPORTANT**
      > Devices should not communicate directly with this service, but should instead send the telemetry to
      > the ingestion endpoint, which updates the `reported` shadow and returns the `desired` shadow.
      > Applications should only write to the `desired` shadow and only read from the 
      > `reported` shadow.

      Service for generating and viewing shipment reports.

      This is an alpha version of the Shipment Reports API and can still be changed in future
      releases.

      A shipment report consists of different metrics calculated on shipments which have been completed successfully.

      Punctuality at origin or at destination measures how accurate the estimated
      departure or arrival was. Dwelling at location measures how much time was spent at locations.

      The metrics are split into two categories. The first category consists of metrics which are calculated
      over all shipments of a shipment plan. The second category consists of metrics which are calculated on
      individual shipments of a shipment plan.
      For example, the `location` metrics belongs to the first category.
      Statistical values, such as `average`, are produced for metrics of the first category only.
    name: Shipment Reports

      The Shipments service manages shipments and shipment plans.

      This is an Alpha version of the Shipments API and can still be changed in future releases.

      A shipment describes a structure of a multimodal logistics journey. Shipments are useful when
      the lifetime of an asset one is tracking spans across multiple devices.

      A shipment consists of segments that span from a location to another. The segments and their
      origins and destinations must form a continuous chain of locations, that is the origin of a segment
      must match the destination of a previous segment. Each segment of the shipment may be assigned a
      `trackingId` that can vary between segments. Devices assigned to a shipment generate traces
      and events for the entire shipment.

      The `shipmentId` of a shipment can be used in similar fashion as a `trackingId` in selected
      APIs. For example, one can query for shipment ***traces*** and ***events*** and associate ***aliases*** and
      ***metadata*** to a shipment.

      Each shipment has one of the following statuses:
      * ***pending***: The shipment has not yet started.
      * ***ongoing***: The shipment has started and it has one segment ongoing.
      * ***completed***: The shipment has ended and all of its segments are completed.
      * ***cancelled***: The shipment has ended and it has one or more cancelled segments.

      HERE Tracking progresses the shipment automatically if each segment has been assigned a
      `trackingId` and the origin and destination locations contain a `geofenceId`. Each segment is
      started upon exiting the origin location of the segment and completed upon entering the
      destination location of the segment. If the origin and the destination of a segment share the
      same location (that is, dwelling in a single location), the segment will automatically be started after the
      previous segment was completed. If a segment does not have a device assigned, the user must
      start and complete the segment manually.

      A new shipment should be instantiated for each separate logistical journey. However, if the
      structure of the shipment is recurring, a shipment plan can be defined. A shipment plan can
      be used to define a generic skeleton for a logistical journey. For example, certain types
      of assets often need to be shipped over a typical sequence of locations.
      A user can create a shipment plan defining the segments, and new shipments can be instantiated from the plan.
      This allows recycling of components for similar shipments and reduces time and effort for
      creating new shipment instances.

      Shipments can also be created, managed and visualized via the [Shipment Tracking web](https://shipment.tracking.here.com).

      The Traces service allows users querying device traces based on time ranges.

      A device trace is a device-ingested telemetry along with the ingestion timestamp 
      and the device current position.

      > **NOTE**:
      > Devices should not communicate directly with this service, but should instead send telemetry to
      > the ingestion endpoint. Each data ingestion results in an update to the `reported` device shadow 
      > and a new device trace creation.

                Text defining the device details in csv format. Rows are separated by a line break and columns by comma.
                The first row must have the field names.

                The maximum number of devices to be uploaded at once is 1000.

                ## Add devices
                Each row represents a single device, that can be already provisioned
                device (in which case deviceId must be provided), un-provisioned device (in which case only name is required
                device identificator field), virtual device (in which case externalId must be provided) or external cloud device,
                for which both `externalDeviceId` and `connectorId` must be provided.
                One can also define device settings to be saved to device desired shadow. Additionally rules and
                geofences can be defined -- those will be associated to the devices. Also device type and tags can be defined.

                The supported field names are the following:

                ### Device identificators
                - `name`: The name of the device. Must be unique within a project. Used to identify the device in the response. Required field.
                - `deviceId`: Device ID of the provisioned device. The device `deviceId` will be claimed to the project `projectId` in the bulk upload process
                - `externalId`: Virtual device external ID that must be unique within a project. The virtual device will be claimed to the project.
                - `externalDeviceId`: Identifier of the device on the external cloud. Must be provided together with `connectorId`. The external device is added to connector.
                - `connectorId`: Identifier of the could-to-cloud connector.
                In case only `name` is provided, a new device is provisioned and claimed to the project. `deviceId` and `deviceSecret` will be provided via "Gets bulk upload results" API

                ### Device settings, labels and associations
                - `sampleMs`: Device sampling rate in milliseconds
                - `sendMs`: Device sending rate in milliseconds (should be equal or greater than sampleMs)
                - `distanceM`: Device sends an update if it has moved farther than the specified distance in meters
                - `areaBased`: Set true/1 if device should be configured to area based mode.
                - `type`: The type of the asset. Can be any user defined string. Type is saved to labels service.
                - `tags`: There are two ways of defining tags in the csv format. Tags are saved to labels service.
                  + `tag:{any}`, e.g. `tag:priority 1,tag:priority 2`: In device row, the tag is applied to the device if the corresponding column has `1` in it.
                  + `tags`: In device row and tags column provide tags separated by `|`, e.g. `priority 1|priority 2`
                - `geofences`: There are two ways of defining geofences to be associated with the device:
                  + `geofence:{geofenceId}`, e.g. `geofence:e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc`: In device row, the geofence is associated to the device if the corresponding column has `1` in it.
                  + `geofences`: In the device row and geofences column provide geofenceIds to be associated with the device, separated by `|` e.g. `2b4c5571-e398-45c5-9637-6ce63e320b4f|e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc`
                - `rules`: There are two ways of defining rules to be associated with the device. The functionality is the same as for geofences. Rules cover both sensor rules that are managed via sensors/v3 endpoint and other rules that are managed via rules/v4 endpoint.
                  + `rule:{ruleId}`, e.g. `rule:e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc`
                  + `rules`: In the device row in rules column specify the rules to be associated to the device, separated by `|`, e.g. `2b4c5571-e398-45c5-9637-6ce63e320b4f|e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc`

                Example 1:
                ```
                name,deviceId,externalId,externalDeviceId,connectorId,sendMs,sampleMs,areaBased,distanceM,geofence:e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc,geofence:2b4c5571-e398-45c5-9637-6ce63e320b4f,rule:b647155e-0789-4fa0-8807-154332c0617d,type

                ```

                Example 2:
                ```
                name,tags,geofences
                tracker1,Priority1;Important,2b4c5571-e398-45c5-9637-6ce63e320b4f|e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc
                tracker2,Important,e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc
                ```

                ## Delete devices
                Each row represents a single tracker to be deleted. Trackers can be identified by
                `trackingId`, `externalId` (for virtual devices) or `externalDeviceId` along with
                `connectorId` (for external cloud devices).
                By default the provided tracker will be both unclaimed and unprovisioned.
                With boolean property `unclaimOnly` one can bypass unprovisioning for selected devices
                and with `removeFromConnectorOnly` both unclaiming and unprovisioning steps will be skipped.

                Example:
                ```
                trackingId,externalId,externalDeviceId,connectorId,unclaimOnly,removeFromConnectorOnly
                HERE-ef63c528-0aea-4f9f-a160-368559fa31ed,,,,1,

        In case current status is completed, failed or cancelled, user can perform action `acknowledged`
        which can be used to mark the job acknowledged.

                                An external cloud-specific object that the driver will use to login to the
                                external cloud. The structure of this object varies per driver
                                implementation.
                                It is recommended to have dedicated credentials for logging in to
                                the external cloud in order not to violate possible concurrent users
                                policies of the external cloud.
                                In case of the HERE Tracking loopback driver, the maximum
                                allowed concurrent user account tokens is 3 per account,
                                therefore it is recommended to create a separate HERE account
                                and grant it the required privilege to update the connector's
                                project, and use that account in externalCloudInfo.

                    An external cloud-specific object that the driver will use to login to the

                    implementation.
                    It is recommended to have dedicated credentials for logging in to
                    the external cloud in order not to violate possible concurrent users
                    policies of the external cloud.
                    In case of the HERE Tracking loopback driver, the maximum
                    allowed concurrent user account tokens is 3 per account,
                    therefore it is recommended to create a separate HERE account
                    and grant it the required privilege to update the connector's
                    project, and use that account in externalCloudInfo.

                An external cloud-specific object that the driver will use to login to the
                external cloud. The structure of this object varies per driver
                implementation.
                It is recommended to have dedicated credentials for logging in to
                the external cloud in order not to violate possible concurrent users
                policies of the external cloud.
                In case of the HERE Tracking loopback driver, the maximum
                allowed concurrent user account tokens is 3 per account,
                therefore it is recommended to create a separate HERE account
                and grant it the required privilege to update the connector's
                project, and use that account in externalCloudInfo.

        Gets all events for all devices and shipments of the project. The results are listed in descending order 
        based on the timestamp. 

        An event is uniquely identified by `trackingId`-`ruleId`-`timestamp` key, 
        with an exception of dwelling and stock rule events. 
        Dwelling events also need `geofenceId` to be specified, 
        whereas for stock events `trackingId` is not applicable.

        A time range can be defined with `before` and `after` timestamps. The response will contain
        an array of events that were recorded within the range.

        If the request is supplied with `eventSource` query parameter, the response will contain
        events generated by the defined source only.

        If the request is supplied with `eventType` query parameter, the response will contain
        events of the specified type only.

        If the request is supplied with `ruleId` query parameter, the response will only contain events
        for the specified rule ID.

        If the request is supplied with `initialState` query parameter, the response will contain
        events having the specified initial state.

        All the aforementioned query parameters can be combined together.

                  Type of the event.

                  An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                  The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                  Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                  generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                  This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                  Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                  transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                  This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                  The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                  (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                  or vice versa.

                  The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                  crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                  This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                  Such events are stateless.

                  Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                  a geofence associated with the device.

                  Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                  stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                  DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                  Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                  stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                  or outside of any geofence. 
                  DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                  Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                  threshold duration.
                  UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                  Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                  inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                  Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                  is too early, on time or delayed.

                    Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                    stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                    DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                    Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                    stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside

        Gets all events statuses for all devices and shipments of the project.
        An event status of a device is the most recent event of any rule or geofence the device 
        is associated with.
        The same applies for shipments.

        The response contains a list of event status objects and
        each object has the following properties:
        * `trackingId` or `shipmentId`: a device ID or a shipment ID
        * `ruleId`: an associated rule or geofence ID
        * `eventSource`: the rule type
        * `eventType`: an event type of the latest event of the rule (same as the "event state")
        * `timestamp`: a time since when the device has been in this event state

        The array is sorted by the following fields in the
        following order: `trackingId`, `eventSource`, `timestamp`, `ruleId`, `geofenceId`.

        A time range can be defined with `before` and `after` timestamps. The response will contain
        event statuses that were recorded within the range.

        If the request is supplied with `eventSource` query parameter, the response results will be limited
        to the specified rule types only.

        If the request is supplied with `ruleId` query parameter, the response results will be limited
        to the specified rule IDs only.

        If the request is supplied with `trackingId` query parameter, the response results will be limited
        to the specified devices only. Also `shipmentId` can be used as a `trackingId`.

        If the request is supplied with `eventType` query parameter, the response results will be limited
        to the specified type only.

        If the request is supplied with `geofenceId` query parameter, it will only affect dwelling 
        event statuses filtering, limiting the results to the specified geofence only.
        Other event types are not affected by this setting.
        Note that for the event statuses of geofence type, the `ruleId` is the `geofenceId`.

        If the request is supplied with `shipments` query parameter, the response results will be limited
        either to shipments (`shipments`=`true`) or devices (`shipments`=`false`) only. 
        Otherwise, if `shipments` query parameter is not specified, response results will include both devices and shipments.

        All the aforementioned query parameters can be combined together.

                  Type of the event.

                  An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                  The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                  Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                  generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                  This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                  Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                  transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                  This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                  The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                  (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                  or vice versa.

                  The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                  crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                  This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                  Such events are stateless.

                  Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                  a geofence associated with the device.

                  Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                  stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                  DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                  Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                  stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                  or outside of any geofence. 
                  DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                  Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                  threshold duration.
                  UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                  Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                  inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                  Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                  is too early, on time or delayed.

      description: |
        This API call counts the number of devices and shipments that are currently in the different 
        event states per rule or per event source (that is per rule type).

        An event state of a device is the event type of the most recent device event.
        It indicates a state the device is currently in, in relation to a rule the device is associated with.

        For example, the event state can be either `INSIDE_GEOFENCE` or `OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE` in case the event source is `geofence`; 
        or `BELOW_RANGE`, `IN_RANGE` or `ABOVE_RANGE` in case the event source is `battery` rule.

        A device can be in several different event states at the same time when it has more than 
        one rule associated with it. 
        For example, a device can be at the same time in `INSIDE_GEOFENCE` and `ABOVE_RANGE` event states.

        The same applies for shipments.

        The `groupBy` query parameter defines how the results are grouped.

        The default value for the `groupBy` parameter is `ruleId`. 
        The response contains a list of objects, one per each rule,
        that are associated to at least one device or shipment of the project.
        Each object has the following properties:
        * `ruleId`: a rule ID
        * `eventSource`: the rule type
        * every distinct event state (applicable for the rule type) and the number of devices in this state
        * `total`: the total number of devices associated to the rule

        When the `groupBy` parameter value is `eventSource`, the response contains a list of objects, one per
        event source (that is per each rule type),
        that are associated to at least one device or shipment of the project.
        Each object has the following properties:
        * `eventSource`: a rule type
        * every distinct event state (applicable for the rule type) and the number of devices in this state. 
          One device is counted only once per `eventType` state, but in case a single device is associated to multiple
          rules of the same type, it will be counted separately for each event state.
        * `total`: the total number of devices associated to the rule type. A single device is counted only once.

        For example, a device A is associated to 2 geofences and is inside one and outside the other.
        A device B is associated to 3 geofences and is outside all of them. With the request 
        query parameter set as `groupBy`=`eventSource`, the response body will contain the following result item:
        ```
        {
          "eventSource": "geofence",
          "INSIDE_GEOFENCE": 1,
          "OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE": 2,
          "total": 2
        }.
        ```

        If the request is supplied with `eventSource` query parameter, the response results will be limited
        to the specified rule types only.

        If the request is supplied with `ruleId` query parameter, the response results will be limited
        to the specified rule IDs only.

        If the request is supplied with `trackingId` query parameter, the response results will be limited
        to the specified devices only. Also `shipmentId` can be used as a `trackingId`.

        If the request is supplied with `geofenceId` query parameter, it will only affect dwelling 
        event statuses filtering, limiting the results to the specified geofence only.
        Other event types are not affected by this setting.
        Note that for the event statuses of geofence type, the `ruleId` is the `geofenceId`.

        If the request is supplied with `shipments` query parameter, the response results will be limited
        either to shipments (`shipments`=`true`) or devices (`shipments`=`false`) only. 
        Otherwise, if `shipments` query parameter is not specified, response results will include both devices and shipments.

        All the aforementioned query parameters can be combined together.

        Gets all events for a device or a shipment. 
        A device is identified by the `trackingId`.
        For shipments, `shipmentId` can be used as a `trackingId`.

        The results are listed in descending order based on the timestamp.

        An event is uniquely identified by `trackingId`-`ruleId`-`timestamp` key, 
        with an exception of dwelling and stock rule events. 
        Dwelling events also need `geofenceId` to be specified, 
        whereas for stock events `trackingId` is not applicable.

        A single event can be fetched using `ruleId`, `before` and `after` query parameters.

        A time range can be defined with `before` and `after` timestamps. The response will contain
        an array of events that were recorded within the range.

        If the request is supplied with `eventSource` query parameter, the response will contain
        events generated by the defined source only.

        If the request is supplied with `eventType` query parameter, the response will contain
        events of the specified type only.

        If the request is supplied with `ruleId` query parameter, the response will only contain events
        for the specified rule ID.

        If the request is supplied with `initialState` query parameter, the response will contain
        events having the specified initial state.

        All the aforementioned query parameters can be combined together.

                  Type of the event.

                  An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                  The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                  Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                  generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                  This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                  Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                  transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                  This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                  The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                  (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                  or vice versa.

                  The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                  crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                  This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                  Such events are stateless.

                  Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                  a geofence associated with the device.

                  Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                  stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                  DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                  Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                  stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                  or outside of any geofence. 
                  DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                  Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                  threshold duration.
                  UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                  Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                  inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                  Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                  is too early, on time or delayed.

        One can specify a geofence as a circle, as a polygon or as POI (Point of Interest). One can also
        assign a name and a description to each geofence to help identify them.

        Circle
        ---

        Specify coordinates of the center point of the circle and a radius in
        meters.

        ```json
            {
              "name": "Home",
              "type": "circle",
              "definition": {
                "center": {
                  "lat": 52.5308398,
                  "lng": 13.38490035
                },
                "radius": 100
              },
              "description": "Small area around my house."
            }
        ```

        Polygon
        ---

        Specify an array of points. A minimum of three points is required.

        *NOTE: If the array of points does not describe a closed polygon, the polygon is
        automatically closed between the last and first points.*

        ```json
            {
              "name": "Work",
              "type": "polygon",
              "definition": {
                "points": [{
                  "lat": 52.5308398,
                  "lng": 13.38490035
                }, {
                  "lat": 52.530443,
                  "lng": 13.38482003
                }, {
                  "lat": 52.5308298,
                  "lng": 13.38492235
                }]
              },
              "description": "The area around work."
            }
        ```

        Indoor geofence
        ---

        Circular and polygonal geofences can be both outdoors and indoors.
        To create a `circular` `indoor` geofence, add the `floor` property to the request body.

        ```json
            {
              "name": "Office indoor",
              "type": "circle",
              "definition": {
                "center": {
                  "lat": 52.5308398,
                  "lng": 13.38490035
                },
                "radius": 20,
                "floor": {
                  "level": 2,
                  "id": "DM_1234",
                  "name": "Office floor 2"
                }
              },
              "description": "Floor 2 of the office."
            }

        ```

        POI geofence
        ---

        Specify location details of a POI geofence for its initial creation.

        After the POI geofence has been created, it will need to be trained.
        The POI geofence boundary is defined using radio measurements.
        The POI geofence is trained using a telemetry 
        that a device has ingested while being at this desired point of interest.

        For a trained POI geofence, an associated device is considered to be inside the 
        geofence when the radio measurements of the device-ingested telemetry and 
        the training data match.

        ```json
            {
              "name": "POI room in the office",
              "type": "poi",
              "definition": {
                "location": {
                  "room": ROOM_201,
                  "address": Invalidenstrasse 116,
                  "country": Germany,
                  "position": {
                    "lat": 52.5308398,
                    "lng": 13.38490035
                  }
                },
                "floor": {
                  "level": 2,
                  "id": "DM_1234",
                  "name": "Office floor 2"
                }
              },
              "description": "A room where goods should be delivered."
            }
        ```

        Successful requests have the HTTP status 201 and the response body provides
        the ID of the created geofence.

        Trains the POI geofence `geofenceId` using a device telemetry.
        The POI geofence boundary is defined using radio measurements.
        The geofence is trained using a telemetry that the device with `trackingId` has ingested 
        during the specified time range, while being at this point of interest.
        Only telemetries that have been ingested during the last 24 hours can be used in the training.

        Optionally, a WLAN scan be used for the training.

        After all parts have been uploaded, this operation completes the upload.

        When the upload has been completed, it is no longer possible to upload
        new parts to it but the uploaded data can be downloaded.

        This request has an optional `abort` query
        parameter (the default value is `false`) for aborting the upload instead
        of successfully completing it. If the upload is aborted, all of its

        Uploads a part of large data. The part is identified with `dataId` and a part number.

        Part upload has the following limits:
        * The part numbers must start from 1, be no greater than 10000 and be consecutive.
        * The size of one uploaded data part must be between 1 byte and 1 MB.
        * Parts re-uploaded with the same `partNumber` are overridden.
        * Only `application/octet-stream` Content-Type is supported.

        Parts can be uploaded in any order, the `partNumber` determines their
        position in the total data.

        The optional `md5` query parameter can be used to provide the MD5
        digest for the uploaded data part. If it is specified and does not match
        to the received data, HERE Tracking returns HTTP status 400.

        If the data upload is still in ***preparing*** state, HERE Tracking
        returns HTTP status 409.

        Updates the metadata object of the device or a shipment identified by the `trackingId` or the `shipmentId`. 
        The metadata specified in the request body is merged with the existing metadata object 
        (or gets created if no metadata object exists); 
        new keys are added, and the values of the existing keys are updated with the new data.
        Adding 'null' value for a key deletes it from the metadata object.
        Successful response body contains the updated metadata object.

                              Type of the event.

                              An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                              The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                              Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                              generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                              This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                              Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                              transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                              This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                              The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                              (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                              or vice versa.

                              The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                              crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                              This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                              Such events are stateless.

                              Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                              a geofence associated with the device.

                              Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                              stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                              DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                              Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                              stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                              or outside of any geofence. 
                              DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                              Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                              threshold duration.
                              UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                              Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                              inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                              Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                              is too early, on time or delayed.

                              crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                              This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                              Such events are stateless.

                              Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                              a geofence associated with the device.

                              Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                              stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                              DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                              Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                              stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                              or outside of any geofence. 
                              DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                              Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                              threshold duration.
                              UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                              Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                              inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                              Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                              is too early, on time or delayed.

                              Type of the event.

                              An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                              The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                              Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                              generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                              This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                              Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                              transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                              This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                              The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                              (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                              or vice versa.

                              The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                              crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                              This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                              Such events are stateless.

                              Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                              a geofence associated with the device.

                              Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                              stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                              DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                              Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                              stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                              or outside of any geofence. 
                              DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                              Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                              threshold duration.
                              UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                              Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                              inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                              Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                              is too early, on time or delayed.

                    Type of the event.

                    An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                    The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                    Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                    generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                    This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                    Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                    transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                    This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                    The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                    (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                    or vice versa.

                    The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                    crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                    This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                    Such events are stateless.

                    Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                    a geofence associated with the device.

                    Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                    stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                    DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                    Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                    stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                    or outside of any geofence. 
                    DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                    Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                    threshold duration.
                    UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                    Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                    inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                    Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                    is too early, on time or delayed.

                    state, which would serve as a starting point for the subsequent rule evaluations.
                    The rest of the rule events would represent a transition of a device or a shipment or 
                    a geofence from one state to another and their `initialState` property will be set to `false`.

                              Type of the event.

                              An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                              The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                              Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                              generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                              This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                              Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                              transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                              This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                              The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                              (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                              or vice versa.

                              The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                              crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                              This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                              Such events are stateless.

                              Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                              a geofence associated with the device.

                              Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                              stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                              DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                              Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                              stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                              or outside of any geofence. 
                              DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                              Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                              threshold duration.
                              UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                              Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                              inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                              Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                              is too early, on time or delayed.

                                    Type of the event.

                                    An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                                    The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                                    Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                                    generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                                    This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                                    Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                                    transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                                    This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                                    The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                                    (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                                    or vice versa.

                                    The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                                    crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                                    This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                                    Such events are stateless.

                                    Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                                    a geofence associated with the device.

                                    Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                                    stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                                    DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                                    Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                                    stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                                    or outside of any geofence. 
                                    DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                                    Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                                    threshold duration.
                                    UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                                    Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                                    inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                                    Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                                    is too early, on time or delayed.

                                    Type of the event.

                                    An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                                    The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                                    Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                                    generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                                    This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                                    Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                                    transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                                    This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                                    The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                                    (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                                    or vice versa.

                                    The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                                    crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                                    This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                                    Such events are stateless.

                                    Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                                    a geofence associated with the device.

                                    Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                                    stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                                    DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                                    Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                                    stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                                    or outside of any geofence. 
                                    DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                                    Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                                    threshold duration.
                                    UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                                    Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                                    inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                                    Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                                    is too early, on time or delayed.

                                    Type of the event.

                                    An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                                    The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                                    Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                                    generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                                    This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                                    Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                                    transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                                    This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                                    The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                                    (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                                    or vice versa.

                                    The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                                    crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                                    This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                                    Such events are stateless.

                                    Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                                    a geofence associated with the device.

                                    Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                                    stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                                    DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                                    Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                                    stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                                    or outside of any geofence. 
                                    DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                                    Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                                    threshold duration.
                                    UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                                    Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                                    inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                                    Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                                    is too early, on time or delayed.

                                    Events with the `initialState` property set as `true` are generated when the rule is 
                                    evaluated for the first time. It indicates the fact that this is the initial evaluation 
                                    state, which would serve as a starting point for the subsequent rule evaluations.
                                    The rest of the rule events would represent a transition of a device or a shipment or 
                                    a geofence from one state to another and their `initialState` property will be set to `false`.

                    Type of the event.

                    An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                    The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                    Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                    generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                    This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                    Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                    transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                    This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                    The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                    (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                    or vice versa.

                    The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                    crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                    This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                    Such events are stateless.

                    Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                    a geofence associated with the device.

                    Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                    stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                    DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                    Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                    stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                    or outside of any geofence. 
                    DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                    Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                    threshold duration.
                    UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                    Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                    inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                    Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                    is too early, on time or delayed.

                              Type of the event.

                              An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                              The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                              Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                              generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                              This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                              Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                              transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                              This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                              The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                              (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                              or vice versa.

                              The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                              crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                              This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                              Such events are stateless.

                              Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                              a geofence associated with the device.

                              Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                              stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                              DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                              Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                              stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                              or outside of any geofence. 
                              DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                              Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                              threshold duration.
                              UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                              Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                              inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                              Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                              is too early, on time or delayed.

                              Type of the event.

                              An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                              The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                              Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                              generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                              This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                              Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                              transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                              This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                              The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                              (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                              or vice versa.

                              The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                              crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                              This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                              Such events are stateless.

                              Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                              a geofence associated with the device.

                              Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                              stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                              DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                              Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                              stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                              or outside of any geofence. 
                              DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                              Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                              threshold duration.
                              UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                              Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                              inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                              Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                              is too early, on time or delayed.

        Claims a device, associating a device to a user account.
        The user who claimed a device is the device owner,
        which is different from the device vendor.

        Unclaimed devices cannot login or send any data to HERE Tracking.
        A claimed device data is stored in HERE Tracking and is available to the
        device owner's project, which the device has been claimed to.

        When a device is claimed, it gets assigned a `trackingId`.
        This is a unique ID associated with the device data in HERE Tracking.

        `trackingId` is different from the `deviceId`.
        The `deviceId` is permanently associated with the hardware, while the `trackingId`
        is associated with the device data.
        If the device is later sold or transferred, the `deviceId` remains the same but the
        `trackingId` changes in case the device is reclaimed.
        This way the new owner cannot access the old data.

        If the user is a member of multiple projects, the target project ID needs to be
        specified in the `projectId` query parameter (note that this is different from the `appId`).

        Only users with a valid HERE Tracking license are authorized to claim
        new devices. Claimed devices are associated with the owner
        application ID, and the total device count is kept up-to-date for billing purposes.

        Starts a batch job to create licenses for either physical devices or
        virtual devices. Virtual devices are meant for cloud-to-cloud use case.

        A physical device license is a `deviceId` and `deviceSecret` credential pair. The batch
        job creates a number of physical device licenses specified by the `count`
        parameter in the request body.
        The response contains an array of `deviceId` and `deviceSecret` pairs.

        Virtual devices are identified with an external device ID and the requestor's
        project `appId`. The virtual device external ID is application-specific
        and the user is free to allocate it as user finds suitable.
        The external IDs for the virtual devices to be created are specified
        in the `devices` array in request body. For virtual devices
        the response contains only an array of `deviceId`s, but no `deviceSecret`s.

        The `autoclaim` parameter can only be used when creating virtual devices.
        If `autoclaim`=`true`, the created virtual devices are immediately claimed
        by the requesting user account. In this case the response contains also
        tracking IDs for the claimed devices.

        Starts a report creation.

        The request body contains a rule ID, and the report start and end time.
        The report will be created based on the event data generated by the rule and devices associated to it.

        The supported rule types are:
        * dwelling
        * detention
        * utilization

        > Note that both the report start and end timestamps must be earlier than the current time, 
        > and no newly ingested data will be automatically added to the report after its creation.

        The created report ID will be provided in the response.

        The generated report is available for one week, after which it will expire 
        and will need to be recreated.
        If there is an already existing report matching the request parameters, its `reportId`
        will be returned in the response and no new report will be generated.

                    For example, to make the report week start on Monday midnight 1st March 2021 in timezone UTC+1:00,
                    set the `start` parameter to be `2021-02-28T23:00:00.000Z` (GMT). Now when getting interval reports,
                    the first week would contain data between `2021-02-28T23:00:00.000Z` and `2021-03-07T23:00:00.000Z` (GMT).

            ID of the geofence.

            One can provide a geofence ID in case one wants to get reports on a specific geofence.
            This parameter can only be used with reports created for a dwelling rule type.

            For example, to get a report on assets' average dwelling time in the specified geofence 
            during each week, create a request specifying the following:
            * `reportId`: ID of a report created for a dwelling rule
            * `measure`: 'duration'
            * `groupBy`: 'asset'

        - description: |
            Defines whether the report metrics, such as cumulative or average, 
            are calculated per asset or per geofence.

            The parameter can have a value 'geofence' only with reports created for a dwelling rule.

            To get a report on how many times on average assets were in detention during each time interval,
            create a request specifying the following:
            * `reportId`: ID of a report created for a detention rule
            * `groupBy`: 'asset'
            * `method`: 'average'
            * `measure`: 'occurrence'

            To get a report on how long all assets dwelled inside each geofence during the report period,
            create a request specifying the following:
            * `reportId`: ID of a report created for a dwelling rule
            * `groupBy`: 'geofence'
            * `measure`: 'duration'

            To get a report on how long each asset dwelled (inside any geofence) during the report period, 
            create a request specifying the following:
            * `reportId`: ID of a report created for a dwelling rule
            * `groupBy`: 'asset'
            * `measure`: 'duration'

              - geofence
            type: string
        - description: |
            Defines the calculation method. 
            The parameter `method` can only be provided along with `interval`.

            The parameter value can be `percentage` only when `measure` is 'asset'.

            For example, to get a report on percentage of all assets that were in use during each week,
            create a request specifying the following:
            * `reportId`: ID of a report created for a utilization rule
            * `interval`: 'week'
            * `method`: 'percentage'
            * `measure`: 'asset'

            When `method` is set to 'cumulative' or 'average' and `measure` is set to 'duration' or 'occurrence',
            the `groupBy` parameter needs to be provided also. 
            For example, to get a report on how long all assets dwelled in total in the specified geofence during
            each week, create a request specifying the following:
            * `reportId`: ID of a report created for a dwelling rule
            * `geofenceId`: ID of a geofence
            * `interval`: 'week'
            * `method`: 'cumulative'
            * `measure`: 'duration'
            * `groupBy`: 'asset'

            When `method` is set to 'cumulative' or 'average' and `measure` is set to 'day',
            the `groupBy` parameter is automatically set to 'asset'. 
            For example, to get a report on how many days on average assets were in use during each month, 
            create a request specifying the following:
            * `reportId`: ID of a report created for a utilization rule
            * `interval`: 'month'
            * `method`: 'average'
            * `measure`: 'day'
            * `groupBy`: 'asset'

        Creates a rule of the specified rule `type` and with the defined `threshold`.
        After the rule has been created, it needs to be associated to a device to get activated.

        Detention rule
        ---
        For a rule of the `detention` type the threshold is defined as a duration in seconds.
        A `DETENTION_STARTED` event gets triggered when the device has remained
        stationary for longer than the threshold duration.
        A `DETENTION_ENDED` event will be generated when the device starts moving again.

        Utilization rule
        ---
        For a rule of the `utilization` type the threshold is defined as a duration in seconds.
        An `UNUTILIZED` event will
        be generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the threshold duration, 
        and `UTILIZED` event gets triggered when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

        Dwelling rule
        ---
        For a rule of the `dwelling` type the threshold is defined as a duration in seconds.
        A `DWELLING_STARTED` event gets triggered when a dwelling time of the device
        inside any device-associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration.
        When the device exits the geofence, a `DWELLING_ENDED` event will be generated.

        Online rule
        ---
        For a rule of the `online` type there is no threshold defined.
        A `TRUE_TO_FALSE` event gets triggered when the
        device is late for the planned ingestion schedule by more than 5 minutes.
        A `FALSE_TO_TRUE` event is generated when the device starts ingesting again after having been offline.
        The planned ingestion schedule needs to be configured in the device `desired shadow`
        (the `desired.system.rate.sendMs` property).

        Stock rule
        ---
        For a rule of the `stock` type the threshold is defined as `minVolume` and/or `maxVolume` values.
        When creating a stock rule, also a geofence ID needs to be specified.
        When the number of devices inside the specified geofence exceeds `maxVolume`, an `OVERSTOCK`
        event will be generated. Similarly, when the number of devices inside the specified geofence
        gets below `minVolume`, an `UNDERSTOCK` event will be generated. When the number of
        devices inside the specified geofence is between `minVolume` and `maxVolume`, a `NORMAL_VOLUME`
        event will be generated. Note that the stock rule only gets triggered for devices that are associated
        to the specified geofence.

        Shipment schedule rule
        ---
        For a rule of the `shipmentSchedule` type there are `before` and `after` deviation time thresholds 
        from the planned shipment ETD/ETA.
        A `SHIPMENT_EARLY` event gets triggered when the shipment is ahead
        of schedule by the number of `before` seconds.
        A `SHIPMENT_DELAYED` event gets triggered when the shipment is behind
        schedule by the number of `after` seconds.
        A `SHIPMENT_ON_TIME` event gets triggered when the shipment is on time.

        When a rule has been successfully created, the response body will contain the created rule ID.

        Creates a sensor rule of the specified rule type.
        After the sensor rule has been created, it needs to be associated to a device to get activated.

        For a sensor rule of the battery, humidity, pressure and temperature type, a `range` parameter needs 
        to be specified, defining both upper and lower thresholds for the sensor readings. 
        When the device ingests data, the reported sensor reading is compared to the defined range 
        and in case in or out of range transition has taken place, an event gets triggered.

        For a sensor rule of the acceleration type, a `threshold` parameter needs 
        to be specified, defining the acceleration threshold value.
        Every time the device reports its accelerometer sensor reading being above the threshold, 
        an event gets triggered.

        For a sensor rule of the attach and tamper types, no additional parameters
        need to be specified.
        The attach sensor detects whether the device is attached to some object (for example to an 
        asset).
        The tamper sensor detects whether the device cover is open or closed. When the cover is open,
        the device is considered to be tampered with.
        Every time the device reports getting attached, detached, tampered with or left with the 
        cover closed (that is, not tampered with), an event gets triggered.

        When a sensor rule has been successfully created, the response body will contain the created rule ID.

        Gets the `trackingId` device shadow that contains both `reported` and `desired` shadows.

        If a `shipmentId` is used instead of a `trackingId`, it will return a
        shadow of the device that was most recently active for the shipment. If the shipment
        is still pending or it has been cancelled or completed, an empty shadow will be returned.

            description: This is a unique ID associated with the device data in HERE Tracking. For physical devices the `trackingId` gets assigned to a device when the device is claimed by a user, and for virtual devices it is an external device ID along with the device project `appId`. Alternatively, a valid `shipmentId` may be used.

                      Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry.
                      Such properties are stored in `system.computed` property of the shadow.

                      fields, the last known information will remain in the shadow. This means that one can
                      see, for example, the last reported temperature or tracker firmware information in the reported shadow,
                      even if the device did not send that information in the latest telemetry.

                              can send telemetry and, for example, use its GNSS receiver if it has one.
                              A tracker switches into flight mode once it detects that it's in an
                              airplane, and leaves that mode once airplane lands. Transport mode has to
                              be triggered by the user, and it's used, for example, during shipping from
                              continent to another. Sleep mode is used when a tracker is stored in
                              a warehouse, and it's triggered by entering or leaving some defined
                              geofence.

                            disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

                              In order to disable tracking, one must at least provide the begin time of the disabling
                              period and define either position or sensor properties one wants to disable. One can also
                              disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

                                  Define begin and end of the disabling period. All trace points with timestamp that falls between begin and end times will be disabled according to the settings defined in the position and sensors properties.

                                        than given new begin time, the existing end time will be deleted.

                      The `reported` shadow contains the most recent position, sensor readings and settings that the
                      device has sent. The reported shadow may also contain additional properties generated by HERE 
                      Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry.
                      Such properties are stored in `system.computed` property of the shadow.

                      In case the most recent telemetry did not contain all the possible
                      fields, the last known information will remain in the shadow. This means that one can
                      see, for example, the last reported temperature or tracker firmware information in the reported shadow,
                      even if the device did not send that information in the latest telemetry.

                      The `reported` shadow contains the most recent position, sensor readings and settings that the
                      device has sent. The reported shadow may also contain additional properties generated by HERE 
                      Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry.
                      Such properties are stored in `system.computed` property of the shadow.

                      In case the most recent telemetry did not contain all the possible
                      fields, the last known information will remain in the shadow. This means that one can
                      see, for example, the last reported temperature or tracker firmware information in the reported shadow,
                      even if the device did not send that information in the latest telemetry.

                                Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry.
                                Such properties are stored in `system.computed` property of the shadow.

                                In case the most recent telemetry did not contain all the possible
                                fields, the last known information will remain in the shadow. This means that one can
                                see, for example, the last reported temperature or tracker firmware information in the reported shadow,
                                even if the device did not send that information in the latest telemetry.

                                        can send telemetry and, for example, use its GNSS receiver if it has one.

        Creates a new shipment. A shipment consists of segments each representing a part of the
        logistics journey. A segment spans from a location to another and each segment may be
        assigned a different tracking device.

        The segments of the shipment must form a continuous chain of locations, that is the origin of a
        segment must match the destination of a previous segment.

        Creates a new shipment plan. A shipment plan is a structure that holds information about a
        recurring shipment. Like a shipment, a shipment plan also consists of segments each
        representing a part of the logistics journey. A segment spans from a location to another and
        each segment may be assigned a different tracking device. The segments of the shipment must form a
        continuous chain of locations, that is the origin of a segment must match the destination of a
        previous segment.

        In addition to shipments, a predefined duration can be assigned to each segment in the plan.
        This information will be used to calculate the Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) and
        Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) when instantiating a shipment from a shipment plan.

        Updates details of a shipment plan identified by the `shipmentPlanId`.
        This is a partial update, meaning that only the provided
        fields will be updated. If `ruleIds` field is specified, it will replace
        the existing rules currently associated with the shipment plan.

        ***Note***:
        `segments` cannot be edited through this API. Changing the order of the segments in a plan
        would cause shipments created from earlier versions of the plan diverge from a shipment
        instantiated from the new plan with different segment structure. Individual segments can
        still be updated via the `shipments/v4/plans/{shipmentPlanId}/{segmentPlanId}` endpoint.

        Updates details of a shipment identified by the `shipmentId`.
        This is a partial update, meaning that only the provided fields will be updated,
        except when updating segments, the whole segments will be replaced fully.

        Changing the status of the shipment affects the statuses of the segments. The following
        status changes are allowed:
        * `pending` â `ongoing`
          * changes the status of the first segment to `ongoing`
        * `pending` â `cancelled`
          * changes the status of all segments to `cancelled`
        * `ongoing` â `cancelled`
          * cancels the current `ongoing` segment and all the succeeding segments
        * `ongoing` â `completed`
          * completes the current `ongoing` segment and cancels all the succeeding segments

        ***Note***:
        `segments` and `autoStart` can be updated via this API call only if the shipment is in
        `pending` state.

        Updates details of a segment identified by the `segmentId`.

        This is a partial update, meaning that only the provided fields
        will be updated.

        Changing the status of a segment affects the statuses of other segments in the shipment. The
        following status changes are allowed:
        * `pending` â `ongoing`
          * changes previous `pending` segments to `cancelled`
          * changes previous `ongoing` segment to `completed` (only for the immediate predecessor of
            this segment)
          * changes previous `ongoing` segment to `cancelled` (for segments that are not immediate
            predecessors of this segment)
          * previous segments in `cancelled` or `completed` states are not affected
        * `pending` ||Â `ongoing` â `cancelled`
          * no changes for other segments
        * `ongoing` â `completed`
          * next segment with status `pending` is changed to `ongoing`

        ***Note***:
        `trackingId` can be updated through this API call only if the segment is in `pending` state.

    get:
      description: |
        Gets all traces of the device `trackingId` that were recorded within the specified time range. 
        The range is defined with `before` and `after` parameters.
        The returned traces are sorted in descending order based on their timestamps.

        NOTE:
        By default, the `after` parameter value is 0, and the `before` parameter is set to the current
        system time.
        Always make sure to specify `before` and `after` parameters explicitly, as otherwise it may take 
        a very long time for the API call to complete.

        If the `trackingId` is substituted with a valid `shipmentId`, the response
        contains a composition of traces of each shipment segment. 
        Traces are only fetched for those segments that are either in `ongoing` or `completed` state.

        The `outliers` parameter can be used to select only traces that have
        been marked as outliers (if the parameter value is `true`), or only traces
        that have not been marked as outliers (if the parameter value is `false`).
        If the `outliers` parameter is not present, all the traces will be returned.

        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters are used for pagination.

For physical devices the `trackingId` gets assigned to a device when the device is claimed by a user, and for virtual devices it is an external device ID along with the device project `appId`. Alternatively, a valid `shipmentId` may be used.

              A tracker switches into flight mode once it detects that it's in an
              airplane, and leaves that mode once airplane lands. Transport mode has to
              be triggered by the user, and it's used, for example, during shipping from
              continent to another. Sleep mode is used when a tracker is stored in
              a warehouse, and it's triggered by entering or leaving some defined
              geofence.

        By default, the `after` parameter value is 0, and the `before` parameter is set to the current
        system time. 
        Always make sure to specify `before` and `after` parameters explicitly, as otherwise it may 
        take a very long time for an API call to complete.

        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters are used for pagination.

                                    device has sent. The reported shadow may also contain additional properties generated by HERE 
                                    Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry.
                                    Such properties are stored in `system.computed` property of the shadow.

                                    In case the most recent telemetry did not contain all the possible
                                    fields, the last known information will remain in the shadow. This means that one can
                                    see, for example, the last reported temperature or tracker firmware information in the reported shadow,
                                    even if the device did not send that information in the latest telemetry.

                                            Tracker mode status of the device. When a tracker is in a normal mode, it
                                            can send telemetry and, for example, use its GNSS receiver if it has one.
                                            A tracker switches into flight mode once it detects that it's in an
                                            airplane, and leaves that mode once airplane lands. Transport mode has to
                                            be triggered by the user, and it's used, for example, during shipping from
                                            continent to another. Sleep mode is used when a tracker is stored in
                                            a warehouse, and it's triggered by entering or leaving some defined
                                            geofence.

        Devices can use this end point to ingest data into HERE Tracking,
        in the same way as via the `/v3` endpoint.

        A device uses its access token obtained via the the `/v2/token` endpoint
        to send telemetry â GPS position, sensor readings, WLAN or Bluetooth scans - to HERE Tracking.

        By default the request is synchronous and the response will be
        the device `desired` shadow. If the request is set
        to be asynchronous, the response will be empty.

        The device position gets resolved based on the `position` and `scan` objects
        provided in the request body (see the objects definitions for details).
        If only `position` is provided, it will be used as the device position.
        If only `scan` is provided, the position will be resolved asynchronously
        via the HERE Positioning API after returning a response.
        If both are provided, `scan` is resolved to a position via the HERE Positioning API,
        and the better of the two positions (provided vs. resolved) will be selected.
        If neither `position` nor `scan` is provided, or if the HERE Positioning API is not able to
        resolve the position, the device position will be left empty.

        The `reported` shadow will be updated with the device latest position information,
        sensor readings and settings ingested by the device.
        The reported shadow may also contain additional properties generated by HERE
        Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry.
        Such properties are stored in the `system.computed` property of the shadow.
        The device shadow can be queried via the `shadows/v2/{trackingId}` endpoint.

        The data ingested by the device will be available as a device trace via the `traces/v2/{trackingId}` endpoint.

        Authenticates a device to HERE Tracking and requests a device access token.

        A device must provide a valid device access token when it sends telemetry to HERE Tracking.
        Tokens can be obtained upon a successful device authentication.

        The device token requests must be signed. The signature method uses the OAuth 1.0 standard.
        For more information on this standard, see the [OAuth Core 1.0](https://oauth.net/core/1.0/) specification.

        Tokens can be requested only by claimed devices.
        A claimed device license, that is ```deviceId``` and ```deviceSecret``` credential pair, is used for creating a signed token request.

        > See the Authentication section for details on how to generate a signed token request.
        > A new signature must be created for each device access token request.
        > Signatures can only be used once.

        Devices can use this end point to ingest data into HERE Tracking.

        A device uses its access token obtained via the the `/v2/token` endpoint
        to send telemetry â GPS position, sensor readings, WLAN or Bluetooth scans - to HERE Tracking.

        Also device owners use this end point to ingest data on behalf of a device.

        The device can be either a real or a virtual device.
        A real device is identified by a `trackingId` assigned to it when the device was claimed.
        A virtual device is identified by an external device ID and the owner's project `appId`.

        In case the ingestion is done by a device owner, the owner should first authenticate himself with
        HERE Tracking and obtain a user access token via the `/users/v2/login` endpoint.
        The user access token will then be used in this API call.

        By default the request is synchronous and the response will be
        the device `desired` shadow. If the request is set
        to be asynchronous, the response will be empty.

        The device position gets resolved based on the `position` and `scan` objects
        provided in the request body (see the objects definitions for details).
        If only `position` is provided, it will be used as the device position.
        If only `scan` is provided, the position will be resolved asynchronously
        via the HERE Positioning API after returning a response.
        If both are provided, `scan` is resolved to a position via the HERE Positioning API,
        and the better of the two positions (provided vs. resolved) will be selected.
        If neither `position` nor `scan` is provided, or if the HERE Positioning API is not able to
        resolve the position, the device position will be left empty.

        The `reported` shadow will be updated with the device latest position information,
        sensor readings and settings ingested by the device.
        The reported shadow may also contain additional properties generated by HERE
        Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry.
        Such properties are stored in the `system.computed` property of the shadow.
        The device shadow can be queried via the `shadows/v2/{trackingId}` endpoint.

        The data ingested by the device will be available as a device trace via the `traces/v2/{trackingId}` endpoint.

                              airplane, and leaves that mode once airplane lands. Transport mode has to
                              be triggered by the user, and it's used, for example, during shipping from
                              continent to another. Sleep mode is used when a tracker is stored in

        Device owner use this endpoint to ingest data to HERE Tracking on behalf of multiple devices.

        A single request can contain data for multiple devices.
        The devices can be either real or virtual.
        A real device is identified by a `trackingId` assigned to it when the device was claimed.
        A virtual device is identified by an external device ID and the owner's project `appId`.

        Prior to making the request, the device owner should first authenticate himself with
        HERE Tracking and obtain a user access token.
        The user access token will then be used in this API call.

        For more information on the device position resolution, and the device shadow and trace updates,
        see the `/v3` endpoint description.

        the external cloud in order not to violate possible concurrent users

        In case of the HERE Tracking loopback driver, the maximum
        allowed concurrent user account tokens is 3 per account,
        therefore it is recommended to create a separate HERE account
        and grant it the required privilege to update the connector's
        project, and use that account in externalCloudInfo.

            Type of the event.

            An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
            The event type depends on the data the device sends.

            Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
            generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
            This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

            Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
            transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
            This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
            The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
            (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
            or vice versa.

            The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
            crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
            This produces events of the type EVENT. 
            Such events are stateless.

            Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
            a geofence associated with the device.

            Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
            stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
            DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

            Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
            stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
            or outside of any geofence. 
            DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

            Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
            threshold duration.
            UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

            Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
            inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

            Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
            is too early, on time or delayed.

                    Type of the event.

                    An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                    The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                    Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                    generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                    This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                    Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                    transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                    This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                    The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                    (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                    or vice versa.

                    The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                    crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                    This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                    Such events are stateless.

                    Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                    a geofence associated with the device.

                    Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                    stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                    DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                    Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                    stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                    or outside of any geofence. 
                    DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                    Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                    threshold duration.
                    UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                    Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                    inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                    Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                    is too early, on time or delayed.

                Type of the event.

                An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                or vice versa.

                The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                Such events are stateless.

                Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                a geofence associated with the device.

                Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                or outside of any geofence. 
                DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                threshold duration.
                UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                is too early, on time or delayed.

                              continent to another. Sleep mode is used when a tracker is stored in
                              a warehouse, and it's triggered by entering or leaving some defined
                              geofence.

                      It is recommended to have dedicated credentials for logging in to
                      the external cloud in order not to violate possible concurrent users
                      policies of the external cloud.

                      allowed concurrent user account tokens is 3 per account,
                      therefore it is recommended to create a separate HERE account
                      and grant it the required privilege to update the connector's
                      project, and use that account in externalCloudInfo.

                          even if the device did not send that information in the latest telemetry.

                          Type of the event.

                          An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                          The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                          Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                          generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                          This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                          Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                          transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                          This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                          The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                          (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                          or vice versa.

                          The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                          crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                          This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                          Such events are stateless.

                          Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                          a geofence associated with the device.

                          Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                          stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                          DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                          Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                          stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                          or outside of any geofence. 
                          DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                          Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                          threshold duration.
                          UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                          Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                          inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                          Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                          is too early, on time or delayed.

                          Type of the event.

                          An event is created every time an associated rule or geofence is triggered by a device ingestion.
                          The event type depends on the data the device sends.

                          Sensors that report numerical data (such as battery, humidity, pressure and temperature sensors),
                          generate an event when the reported sensor reading of the device goes in or out of range, which is configured in the rule.
                          This produces events of BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE types.

                          Sensors that report boolean data (such as attach and tamper sensors), generate events when the device 
                          transitions from one state to another, either from `false` to `true` or vice versa.
                          This produces events of FALSE_TO_TRUE and TRUE_TO_FALSE types.
                          The same event types are also generated by the online rule when the device state changes from `offline` 
                          (when the device has stopped ingesting data) to `online` (when the device data ingestion has resumed) 
                          or vice versa.

                          The acceleration sensor generates events whenever the reported sensor reading 
                          crosses the acceleration threshold (for example, when the device was dropped).
                          This produces events of the type EVENT. 
                          Such events are stateless.

                          Events of INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE types are generated when the device enters or exits
                          a geofence associated with the device.

                          Events of DWELLING_STARTED type are generated when the device has
                          stayed inside an associated geofence for longer than the threshold duration. 
                          DWELLING_ENDED type events are generated when dwelling of the device has ended.

                          Events of DETENTION_STARTED type are generated when the device has been
                          stationary for longer than the threshold duration, regardless whether the device is inside 
                          or outside of any geofence. 
                          DETENTION_ENDED type events will be generated when the device starts moving again.

                          Events of UNUTILIZED type are generated when the device has been stationary for longer than the
                          threshold duration.
                          UTILIZED type events are generated when the device starts moving again after having been stationary.

                          Events of OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK types are generated when the number of assets
                          inside a geofence crosses the `minVolume` and `maxVolume` thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                          Events of SHIPMENT_EARLY, SHIPMENT_ON_TIME and SHIPMENT_DELAYED types are generated when a shipment
                          is too early, on time or delayed.

                  The `reported` shadow contains the most recent position, sensor readings and settings that the
                  device has sent. The reported shadow may also contain additional properties generated by HERE 
                  Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry.
                  Such properties are stored in `system.computed` property of the shadow.

                  In case the most recent telemetry did not contain all the possible
                  fields, the last known information will remain in the shadow. This means that one can
                  see, for example, the last reported temperature or tracker firmware information in the reported shadow,
                  even if the device did not send that information in the latest telemetry.

                          geofence.

        The response body contains an array of traces, `count` is the number of
        returned items and `pageToken` is the next page token if available.

        If no traces are found, an object with an empty data array is returned.

        Traces are sorted in descending order based on their timestamps.

            The `reported` shadow contains the most recent position, sensor readings and settings that the
            device has sent. The reported shadow may also contain additional properties generated by HERE 
            Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry.
            Such properties are stored in `system.computed` property of the shadow.

            In case the most recent telemetry did not contain all the possible
            fields, the last known information will remain in the shadow. This means that one can
            see, for example, the last reported temperature or tracker firmware information in the reported shadow,
            even if the device did not send that information in the latest telemetry.

                The `reported` shadow contains the most recent position, sensor readings and settings that the
                device has sent. The reported shadow may also contain additional properties generated by HERE 
                Tracking based on the device-ingested telemetry.
                Such properties are stored in `system.computed` property of the shadow.

                In case the most recent telemetry did not contain all the possible
                fields, the last known information will remain in the shadow. This means that one can
                see, for example, the last reported temperature or tracker firmware information in the reported shadow,
                even if the device did not send that information in the latest telemetry.

                    Tracking can be disabled and enabled by defining disableTracking object.
                    In order to disable tracking, one must at least provide the begin time of the disabling
                    period and define either position or sensor properties one wants to disable. One can also
                    disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

                        Define begin and end of the disabling period. All trace points with timestamp that falls between begin and end times will be disabled according to the settings defined in the position and sensors properties.

        A token obtained from a separate endpoint using client credentials and an OAuth 1.0a HMAC-SHA256 signed request.

        Users are authenticated using an OAuth 1.0 bearer token obtained using the `/users/v2/login` endpoint.

        Devices are authenticated using an OAuth 1.0 bearer token obtained using the `/v2/token` endpoint.

        Make a request using the bearer token for authentication
        ---

        Make a request with an `Authorization` header containing the obtained bearer token.

        Example:

        ```
            Authorization: Bearer h1.yxPIksZ0ViLq77f1Nh-9cg.NVgGBZVlCU8G7kjV_...
        ```

    signedRequest:
      description: |
        HERE Tracking requires that you sign your requests for tokens. The signature method uses the OAuth 1.0 standard. For more information on this standard, see the [OAuth Core 1.0](https://oauth.net/core/1.0/) specification.

        > **Note:** You must create a new signature for each token request to HERE Tracking. Signatures can only be used once.

        Create the Signature Base String
        ---

        The first step in creating a signature is to create the signature base string. This string contains the parameters to use when generating the signature.

        *1. To begin, make sure you have the information listed in the following table.*

        | Parameter                | Description                              |
        | ------------------------ | -----------------------------------------|
        | oauth\_consumer\_key     | The device ID for which you want to generate a token. |
        | oauth\_signature\_method | Always use "HMAC-SHA256".                 |
        | oauth\_timestamp         | The number of seconds since the Unix epoch at the point the request is generated. This must be within 10 seconds of the timestamp returned by the `/v2/timestamp` endpoint. |
        | oauth\_nonce             | A unique string for this signature. The string cannot have been used in a previous signature. Each token generation request to HERE Tracking must have a unique signature, and the value in this parameter is what is used to ensure the signature is unique. |
        | oauth\_version           | Always use "1.0".                         |

        *2. Combine these values into a single string by following these steps:*

           1. URL encode every key and value.
           2. Sort the list of key-value pairs alphabetically by key.
           3. Concatenate each key/value pair, separating each with an ampersand character ("&").

        The result is a parameter string that looks like this (line breaks are added for legibility):

           ```
           oauth_consumer_key=47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2
           &oauth_nonce=LIIpk4
           &oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA256
           &oauth_timestamp=1513634609
           &oauth_version=1.0
           ```

        *3. Combine the HTTP method, base URL, and parameter string into a single string called the "base string". This will be the string from which the signature is generated. The base string is in this format:*

           ```
           POST&https://tracking.api.here.com/v2/token&<URL encoded parameter string>
           ```

           The base string consists of:

           1. The HTTP method in caps (POST) followed by an ampersand ("&")
           2. The URL of the HERE Tracking token endpoint followed by an ampersand ("&")
           3. The URL-encoded parameter string.

           For example (line breaks are added for legibility):

           ```
           POST
            &https%3A%2F%2Ftracking.api.here.com%2Fv2%2Ftoken
            &oauth_consumer_key%3D47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2%26
            oauth_nonce%3DLIIpk4%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA256%26
            oauth_timestamp%3D1513634609%26oauth_version%3D1.0
           ```

           > **Note:** The URL-encoded base string should contain exactly two ampersands ("&").

        Create the signature
        ---

        The signing key used to sign the base string is the `deviceSecret` followed by an ampersand ("&").

        Create the signature by passing the signature base string and the signing key to the `HMAC-SHA256` hashing algorithm and converting the result to a `base64` string. Then, use the signature to request a token.

        Request the token
        ---

        Make a `POST` request to this endpoint with an `Authorization` header constructed from the above parameters and the generated signature.

        Example:

        ```
            Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2",
                oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA256",
                oauth_timestamp="1513634609",
                oauth_nonce="LIIpk4",
                oauth_version="1.0",
                oauth_signature="pQ9EJX14L736B%2Br7uZl4yQlO6Xw%3D"
        ```
      scheme: oauth
      type: http
