        Offers are seller's products and SKUs that were sent to the marketplace, and already have their price and inventory level configured. 

         This endpoint retrieves the available offers in a marketplace. It differs from the Get Suggestions endpoints, since it retrieves products that were already matched by the marketplace, and are currently in its catalog. 

        It is possible to filter the search through the following parameters: 

        - rows 
        - sort 

        - start 

        - fq
      operationId: Getofferslist
      parameters:
        - description: |-
            Criteria used to sort the list of offers. For sorting values in ascending order, use `asc`, while for descending order, use `desc`. To fill in the field, insert the sorting criteria, followed by 'asc', or 'desc', separated by a comma. You can sort by the following criteria: 

            - **price:** sorts offers by price. *Ascending* goes from lowest to highest price, while *Descending* goes from highest to lowest price. 

            - **name:** sorts offers by *productName*, in alphabetical order. *Ascending* goes from *A* to *Z*, while *Descending* goes from *Z* to *A*. 

            - **availability:** availability in the sales channel (sc). The default value is 1. 

            Ex. sort=availability,desc

        This endpoint is triggered by the seller onboarding wizard, once the seller confirms their invitation. It can be used by marketplace operators to manually accept seller leads, and carry on with their onboarding process. 

        Note that there's no specific API call that allows status changes. The operations only allow the seller lead to move forward: 

         From `invite` > to `Accept` > closing on `Create Seller`.  

        If you want to change the status, you can start the process again, by deleting that lead through the *Delete Seller Lead* endpoint, and resending the invite through the *Resend Seller Lead's Invite* endpoint.

        This endpoint is used by marketplace operators to create seller accounts. The request will only accept Seller Leads whose status is `accepted`. If they are already `connected` or `invited`, the call will not be fulfilled. 

        The creation of the account at VTEX is done by an internal Billing service. There is no seller account and marketplace affiliation if you do not go through this step. 

        Note that there's no specific API call that allows status changes. The operations only allow the seller lead to move forward: 

         From `invite` > to `Accept` > closing on `Create Seller`.  

        If you want to change the status, you can start the process again, by deleting that lead through the *Delete Seller Lead* endpoint, and resending the invite through the *Resend Seller Lead's Invite* endpoint.
