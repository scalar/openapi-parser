  description: The Nookipedia API provides endpoints for retrieving *Animal Crossing* data pulled from the [Nookipedia wiki](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Main_Page). A couple of the key benefits of using the Nookipedia API is access to data spanning the entire *Animal Crossing* series, as well as information that is constantly updated and expanding as editors work on the wiki.<br><br>Access to the Nookipedia API requires obtaining a key. This is so we can manage our scale and provide better support for our users. To request access to the API, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/wLwtXLerKhfDrRLY8).<br><br>This API is 'version 2' of our [original API](https://nookipedia.com/api/). While the previous API scraped information directly from the wiki, this new edition of the API pulls data from a structured and constrained database, resulting in higher-quality data, better searching, and support for filtering.

When `current` is specified, the return body will be an object with two arrays inside, one called `north` and the other `south` containing the fish available in each respective hemisphere. Note that the current month is calculated based off the API server's time, so it may be slightly off for you at the beginning or end of the month.
