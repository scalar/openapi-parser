      description: <p>Stops an DataSync task execution that's in progress. The transfer of some files are abruptly interrupted. File contents that're transferred to the destination might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files.</p> <p>However, if you start a new task execution using the same task and allow it to finish, file content on the destination will be complete and consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that interrupt a task execution. In all of these cases, DataSync successfully completes the transfer when you start the next task execution.</p>

You activate the agent in the Amazon Web Services Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks are created in this Amazon Web Services Region.</p> <p>You can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud) or provide the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the public internet.</p> <p>You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run. </p> <p>Agents are automatically updated by Amazon Web Services on a regular basis, using a mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks.</p>

This means the result of running the operation might not reflect that you just created or deleted an agent. For example, if you create an agent with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateAgent.html">CreateAgent</a> and then immediately run <code>ListAgents</code>, that agent might not show up in the list right away.
